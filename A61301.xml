            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Should not have troubled thee with any Preface, were it not to comply with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſome Friends, and the Mode of the Times.</p>
            <p>This Treatiſe (which I have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to expoſe to publick view and cenſure of all) I deſire thee to take notice, is much of it a Collection, gathered from the Words and Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Perſons concerned in this Controverſy; methodized and reduced to Form and Order (as my ſlender Knowledg and Leiſure gave me leave) for the benefit of all well-diſpoſed People that have a deſire to look into the things contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in this Point, and either could not reach the Price, or procure thoſe large Volumes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Subject is largely handled, by Men of piercing Judgments and known Abilities: here they may ſee the Subſtance of all the Controverſy compendiouſly, in a little room, and with that plainneſs and brevity, that the meaneſt Capacity may reach it, as well with their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding as their Purſes.</p>
            <p>I know that thoſe who live at eaſe, and have none to diſturb the Peace of their Church, and the Proſperity of the Goſpel, by ſowing Tares in the Lord's Field, may think it ſtrange in
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:35591:4"/> this Day (wherein there ſhould be rather a heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Breaches, and a cloſing up the old Wounds than a heightning and increaſing of them) to ſee any appear in print upon this Subject; nor have I done this as if I could be a Means to bring any new Matter which by former Worthys had not been ſaid before, but for the ſettling and eſtabliſhment of thoſe to whom I belong, ſome of them looking that way; that ſo Satan might not beguile them to draw them from the ſimplicity and purity of that Doctrine revealed in the Word of God, and that I might prevent others from falling into error, through the ſtudious La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of many of corrupt Judgments, who, to our great ſorrow we have found, care not how they ſtumble the weak, or what Diviſions they make in the Houſe of God, ſo they can but proſelite a Party to carry on their uncouth Notions and prepoſterous Opinions, and whoſe heady Zeal hath brought this forth.</p>
            <p>Tho at firſt it was written for the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a few private Friends, yet without any deſign for the Preſs, and hath been kept from it this two or three years, till of late this Opinion hath held up its head in our Parts; which tho it hath formerly and of late been often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered by the Sword of the Spirit, yet like the Monſter <hi>Hydra,</hi> having one Head chop'd off, two grew again: So this Error ſeems to ſpread and grow faſter than of late; and tho they have left off openly to aſſert (tho owned in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate) many of thoſe frightful Sayings, and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Blaſphemies found in many Authors, which are enough to make a godly Man's heart to bleed; yet now they with open face maintain, and by
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:35591:4"/> ſecret ways labour to undermine the Divine Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and by crying up Grace, and the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionality of the Goſpel-Covenant, and deſcry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Inducements to Dutys and Obedience, as legal Preaching, with the terrible noiſe of Free-willers, Arminians, Popery: many well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning Chriſtians, by ſuch ſubtile Wiles, and ſecret Inſinuations, are wounded and deceived through the cunning pretence of ſome that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to a more than ordinary pitch of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Purity, who, to carry on their Deſign, labour to work upon the Affections, and to gain upon the Hearts of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe that are ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain as Goſpel any Errors, becauſe of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the Perſon that broach'd them; and when once the Judgment is diſtempered by Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, all things are carried according to the pleaſure of it. The vileſt Deformitys, if they are Affection's Darlings, ſhall be accounted comely Ornaments: Let God and Man ſay what they will, 'tis all in vain; when their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is captivated and lull'd aſleep by their <hi>Dalilah,</hi> then Judgment and right Reaſon muſt truckle, and thoſe dark and myſterious Sayings in the Scripture muſt be made to ſpeak according as they fancy, while wholeſome Truths are diſtaſtful, and will not go down by reaſon of ſome Prejudice conceived againſt the Author.</p>
            <p>And therefore I am not without a foreſight, that both my Perſon, and this my good Meaning, will be made the Butt at which will be ſhot all thoſe ſharp Arrows that Wit, Pride, and Envy can invent: But I am content to receive a Scratch, that others may ſcape a Wound, and to be accounted as the Filth and Off-ſcouring of all
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:35591:5"/> things, that thoſe who are intangled in Errors might learn the Truth; and therefore if I be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached for it, notwithſtanding all the care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I am content to ſuffer Reproach for the Cauſe of Chriſt, and do count it a very ſmall thing to be judged of Man's Judgment.</p>
            <p>And, Reader, I do aſſure thee, in the words of a Chriſtian, that it is neither Profit, nor Credit, nor Thanks that I expect for my pains, but rather the contrary. I by experience find Perſons are too apt to be offended with Truth and Plainneſs; yea, many mens Spirits are ſo exaſperated againſt ſuch as hold forth the Grace of God to all (which is the Subject of this Book) that if it were in their power, they would convince us we were in the wrong by Fire and Faggot; ſo diſtaſtful are either the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or Writings of thoſe that would take their <hi>Diana</hi> (that is, their Opinion) from them; and when they cannot ward off the down-right ſtroke of Truth, they will then ſet themſelves to cenſure, ſlight, and revile thoſe that ſpeak for Truth. But great is Truth, and it will prevail in ſpight of the Sharp Tongues, or Iron Teeth of thoſe that oppoſe it. And now, Reader, if thou beeſt a <hi>Reprobatarian,</hi> I do not know what cauſe thou haſt to diſlike me, or this Book, if thou wilt be true to thy Principles, that God from all Eternity freely and unchangeably ordain'd what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever comes to paſs, and that God hath preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decreed what Good and Evil ſhall be done; that all things happen not only by God's Preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but by his expreſs Order and poſitive De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; and that Man doth that which is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for him to do, by the juſt impulſe of God. If
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:35591:5"/> this be ſo, then ſurely all that I have done in this caſe, is but the neceſſary Iſſue of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Decrees, having done nothing but what was not only natural, but neceſſary, being over-born by Fate, which I could not withſtand; and if I have done amiſs, I deſerve pity from you rather than blame, tho I know (if your Doctrine be true) neither your Pity nor Prayers will do me any good, unleſs they were able to make a change in God's abſolute Decree: for there cannot one Soul be ſaved which is ordained to Hell, nor one Soul be caſt away which is appointed to Heaven; and ſo your Pity and Prayers may as well be ſpared, as ſpent to no purooſe.</p>
            <p>And, Reader, if thou beeſt one that art learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 'tis likely thou wilt think this Diſcourſe is a home-ſpun Piece: Why truly I am juſt of your mind, I think the ſame, and ſo there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger we ſhould fall out; and by this let thee know it was deſigned for them that love to have it ſo, and written for the uſe of thoſe that neither could nor did expect any Rhetorical Flouriſhes, or School-Diſtinctions from me, but only plain Truths: They knew that as I was ignorant of School Phraſes, ſo I was clogged with worldly Buſineſs, and had neither learning nor time to dreſs up my Lines with Wit and Eloquence; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth Truth ſtand in need of gingling Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes or outward Bedaubing to make it more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned in the World, it being beſt ſeen in its naked plainneſs.</p>
            <p>And, Reader, if thou art a Critick (as this is a peeviſh and critical Age) or ſo highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, that thou diſdaineſt to look any farther, all that I ſhall ſay to thee is this, It will not
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:35591:6"/> hurt you if you can but let it alone: I never commanded you, neither do I care whether you read it or not; and if you read it, and think your time and pains ill beſtowed, blame your ſelf for meddling with that you had nothing to do with. I know that all courteous and impartial Readers, and eſpecially thoſe that have deſired this, will eſteem it as much as I deſire they ſhould.</p>
            <p>Reader, I will keep thee out no longer, pray walk in, and if you like your poor entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you are heartily welcome; fall to, and much good may it do you. <hi>Vale.</hi>

If their Proſperity deſtroy them, if his Mercies (which ſhould lead them to Repentance, and have been a powerful means to ingage their hearts to love the Lord) any ways heighten their guilt, and thereby fit them for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; 'tis not the effect of God's good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but rather of their obſtinate wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, their abuſing his Goodneſs, and <hi>turning his Grace into Wantonneſs,</hi> and not into Thankfulneſs; this is that which kindles the wrath of God, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 25. <hi>But He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah

                  <p>How can we think that he ſhould ſend them one after another into this World, to enjoy ſome of the good things of this Life, and after this ſhort Life is over, to torment them with Devils and damn'd Spirits for ever, to ſhew his Power over them without juſt cauſe in the Creature?

                  <p>You are under a great miſtake; the great Controverſy lay about the Terms of Juſtification, whether by the Law or Faith, and not about perſonal Election and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; ſo that the Prerogative which the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35591:12"/> Lord claims to himſelf as a Royalty annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Crown of Heaven and Earth, in this 9th of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or elſewhere, in reſpect to the Condemnation and Eternal Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Creatures, ſtands not in leaving what Perſons he pleaſeth to eternal ruin, but in making the condition of Life and Death, Salvation and Damnation as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, according to the Counſel of his own Will, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 1. Now the Apoſtle was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Way and Method that God will take in ſaving Sinners; and that it is not the purpoſe of God, that men ſhould be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Law, but by Grace, and through Faith: and tho the Jews much boaſted of their being <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and their obſerving of the Law, and judged it an equal thing, that God ſhould make that Law to be the Law of Life, and Salvation to Men, and the neglect of it the Law of Death and Damnation; yet it being the good Pleaſure of God to do otherwiſe, and to ordain Faith in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, to be the way of Juſtification and Life, and Unbelief the way to Condemnation and Death, this Choice or Election ſhall ſtand, whatever Men may think meet and fitting for him to do. Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>Verſe</hi> 15. <hi>I will have Mercy upon whom I will have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and I will have Compaſſion upon whom I will have Compaſſion.</hi> Men ſhall not preſcribe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me Laws or Terms of ſhewing Mercy;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35591:13"/> my Will ſhall not be bounded by Man's Will, neither will I be obliged by them what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Perſons, or how qualified, I ſhall juſtify and ſave; I mean to keep cloſe to the Counſel of my own Will, in that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Life and Death, the Salvation or Deſtruction of my Creatures; and ſo in this 21ſt Verſe, <hi>Hath not the Potter power over his Clay? &amp;c.</hi> meaning that God Almighty hath the like Power over the whole Lump of Mankind in <hi>Adam,</hi> to make what Laws of Life and Death he pleaſed, and to appoint what manner of Perſons ſhould be ſaved or condemned, which the Potter hath over the Lump of Clay, to make what Veſſel he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth for Honour or Diſhonour. Now at beſt, this Scripture is but an Alluſion; and ſhould we ſuppoſe, that the Apoſtle doth compare the Lord to a Potter, as we often in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture find him compared to Perſons and Things, and human Actions, Affections, and Members of a Man attributed to God and divine Things, becauſe God in his Word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends as it were to our Capacities, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing heavenly Matters after the manner of Men; yet it is not neceſſary, that all thoſe things which are attributed to God, ſhould have ſomething in his Nature correſpondent to them; according to that ancient Saying, <hi>Similitudes are not wont to run on all-fours. Metaphors</hi> are not to be ſtrain'd to expreſs things in themſelves quite oppoſite, nor
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35591:13"/> make the parallel run till it grows lame; but great care muſt be taken, that no mean, baſe, or unworthy thing be attributed to the moſt high. And therefore from the Potter's Power over his Clay, to make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a Veſſel of Honour or Diſhonour as he pleaſeth; to infer poſitively from thence, that God hath purpoſely made ſome to be Veſſels of Wrath, is an unjuſtifiable Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from that Similitude. Surely the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt compares not our moſt wiſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to a fooliſh Potter; who, becauſe he might make what he would of his Clay, did therefore make the greateſt number of his Pots to be broken again, to ſhew that he had as well a Power to break them, as to make them, which none but a mad Man would do; but rather to a wiſe Potter, that deſigns his Work for ſome good end and uſe: Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God ſo made all things, that not one of his Creatures hath ſo much cauſe of diſlike, as to ſay, <hi>why haſt thou made me thus?</hi> No Veſſel of Wrath came ſo made out of his Hands: So that if any be Veſſels of Wrath, the fault is not in him, but in themſelves, by reaſon of their Infidelity and Contempt of the Lord, and his long Sufferance. I know this place is uſually made uſe of, as a Fortreſs for ſuch as you are to flee to, and is miſunderſtood to imply what you ſay; but if you will but mind what the Apoſtle was upon, and let this place be expounded by the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35591:14"/> Context, and other places of holy Scripture, ſo that the whole, and every part of God's Word may agree in one Truth, then we ſhall never take it in this ſenſe of yours; for then this dark and obſcure part of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle (which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>many wreſt to their own Deſtruction,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16.) muſt be taken openly to oppoſe and contradict the whole Courſe and Tenour of God's Word. Is there no way to underſtand the 9th of the <hi>Romans,</hi> than by making thoſe places which ſound ſeverely to claſh againſt thoſe that ſound compaſſionately? Is it not far the beſt way to interpret hard and doubtful Texts, by thoſe many Texts that are clear and eaſy, than to interpret the many clear Texts by one that is dark and difficult? or if one Scripture may have a double ſenſe, muſt we needs take it in the worſt? muſt I needs ſay, that the Father of Mercy, and God of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, which <hi>doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of Men,</hi> did abſolutely damn him, before he had done either good or evil? is it not the beſt ſo to underſtand it, that his Mercy and Juſtice, his Love and Power may imbrace and kiſs each other? Now the Scripture ſpeaks in ſome places darkly and dubiouſly, in other places it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the ſame thing more clearly and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly; the doubtful are to be expounded by the certain, and dark places by thoſe that are clear, and all Expoſition anſwerably to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35591:14"/> the Current of Scripture not contrary to it. Now it doth ſeem as if the Apoſtle in theſe Words had an Eye to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 18. 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where he ſpeaks of the Clay in the Potter's Hands; not as it was in Creation, but in Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; being marr'd in the Hands of the Potter; and ſo finding it would not be for that uſe he deſigned it for, made thereof a Veſſel as pleaſeth him: <q rend="inline">So God ſometimes, whilſt he is at work to faſhion a Soul for his own Work, by the preaching of the Goſpel, by the ſweet motion of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by Mercy and long Sufferance; yet the Veſſel is marr'd, the Clav yields not, nor is pliable to the Will of God; and ſo finding it will not be a fit Veſſel for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he makes a Veſſel of Diſhonour.</q> Read the 7, 8, 9, <hi>Verſes,</hi> and compare them with 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 20, 21. ſo that it is plain, God made of one Lump all Innocent and Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. Eccleſ.</hi> 7. <hi>ult.</hi> at the firſt. See what Mr. <hi>Loveday</hi> ſaith upon this, in his <hi>Perſonal Reprobation Reprobated, Page</hi> 243; <q rend="inline">God (ſaith he) like a Potter makes of low vile Man honourable Veſſels: Hath not the Potter, any ordinary Potter, power over the Clay, to make it what Veſſel he pleaſeth? and when a piece there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of runs coarſe, and is marr'd upon the Wheel, hath he not power to make it a leſs honourable Veſſel? and hath not God the ſame (and much more power) over you
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35591:15"/> that have imbas'd your ſelves by ſlighting, and abuſing all thoſe Mercies he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to beſtow upon you, and thereby make you honourable? To be plain (ſaith the Apoſtle) why may not God for your Diſobedience and Rebellion to his Son, as zealous as you are for the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of a glorious People, and inveſted with all thoſe extraordinary Privileges, make you a baſe and contemptible People; and beſides your continuing ſtill in Unbelief, make your Condition far worſe in the World to come?

                  <p>Why, as God hardened his heart, ſo that he could not but be diſobedient to all the Applications of God by <hi>Moſes</hi> to him; ſo thoſe that are under an Eternal Decree of Reprobations; are under an impoſſibility of repenting or believing. In this <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 17. the Apoſtle ſhews that God raiſed <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> made him a Man, a King, gave him Power over the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> left him to the Corruption of his own heart, for the ſame purpoſe to manifeſt his Glory in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and Deſtruction.</p>

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>You have no ſaying in the whole Book of God, that ſpeaks of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reprobated to eternal miſery before he was born; or that he was decreed and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained before he was born, by the Lord, to be a Veſſel of Wrath; or that God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him for this ſame purpoſe, that he might make his Power known in his Deſtruction. And therefore, as Mr. <hi>Loveday</hi> ſheweth upon theſe words in his <hi>Perſonal Reprobation Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,</hi> p. 157, 158, 159. 'tis not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as referr'd to his Creation, or raiſing him to be a King, for then this Meſſage
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35591:17"/> would have been applied to him when God firſt ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> to him, but we have not one word of it, till after the ſix Plagues; and now he ſpeaks of raiſing him up: ſo that this raiſing up muſt have reſpect to God's deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in extending ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Favour to him, and ſo (ſaith he) <q rend="inline">To raiſe up ſignifieth (as the Learned in the Greek tell us) to raiſe up out of ſome low ſtate and condition; ſometimes out of ſome Sickneſs, <hi>James</hi> 5. 15. The Hebrew words from whence the Apoſtle draws this, (Latined <hi>Stare feci</hi>) is read thus, I have made thee to ſtand; the vulgar Latin reads it, I have ſuſtained thee; the Septuagint reads, Thou wert kept alive; the Chaldee Paraphraſe reads, For this cauſe have I endured thee, or patiently born with thee; the generality of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as well Calviniſts as others, do receive this as the moſt proper reading; I have made thee to ſtand; I have kept or ſuſtained thee; thou haſt been laid low under the ſentence of Death, but upon <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Interceſſion I have raiſed thee up, I have reſcued thee, I have forgiven thy diſobedience, and tried thee again, by taking off my Plagues from thee and thy Land; but if ſtill after all this, thou ſhould'ſt remain obſtinate and rebellious, then the ſtroke ſhall be the heavier at laſt, my Power ſhall be ſeen in thy Deſtruſtion.</q>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:35591:17"/> And now as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would not obey the Lord, in letting his People go, but bore himſelf proudly and ſtubbornly againſt the Lord, (being ſeduced by the Magicians) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he had taſted of God's long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering and Mercies in raiſing him up at the requeſt of his Servant <hi>Moſes;</hi> ſo now he ſhould deeply feel his Power in his Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſo will the Lord do to all wilful rejecters of his Grace and Mercy in Chriſt Jeſus, in theſe Goſpel days. But I obſerve farther, that you ſeem to ſay, that God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to be rebellious and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted againſt him, by an eternal Decree, ſo that he could not but be diſobedient: But ſurely God doth not neceſſitate that which is contrary to his Nature; See <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 5. where Chriſt grieved for the hardneſs of their hearts, which, ſaith Mr. <hi>Loveday</hi> p. 173. ſuppoſeth theſe 4 things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. That Chriſt had done what he could, <hi>i. e.</hi> what he could in Wiſdom and Juſtice, to ſoften their hearts.</p>

                  <p>But did not the Lord tell <hi>Moſes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that he would harden his heart, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 21?</p>

                  <p>'Tis true, God did predict this Judgment which was afterward executed; he did tell <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he would harden <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart, that is conditionally, if he firſt hardened his own; for we find that the Scripture charges this Sin of hard-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelf, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 6. So that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> firſt hardens his heart againſt God, and after that, God even in Judgment, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him up to this hardening, as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his ſin and diſobedience: for God never changeth the nature of a ſoft heart into a hard one; and though it is ſaid by God, <hi>I will harden Pharaoh</hi>'s <hi>heart,</hi> yet God did not do it primarily, or neceſſarily, as may be ſeen by the means God uſed, which tended rather to ſoften than harden him, though accidentally he did, and that many ways, (<hi>Loveday</hi> p. 178.) by ſending that Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to him to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> depart his Land, which was ſo much againſt his proud and covetous Intereſt: If God had been pleaſed that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould ſtill have been Slaves to him, we had not heard of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion as we now do.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt, Thus God was concern'd in harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart, as he croſt his will by declaring his own.</p>

                  <p n="2">2dly, God accidentally hardened <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart, by declaring himſelf above him in Power; this muſt needs provoke him, to hear of a <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3dly, By deferring the full Revenging Power ſo long as he did, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8. 11.</p>
                  <p n="4">4thly, God hardened his heart acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, by his condeſcending to remove his Judgments ſo ſoon at his requeſt: and that this Act of God hardened his heart, you have declared in the Hiſtory; when God had removed this or that Plague, it is ſaid that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> hardened his heart: So that after <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had hardened his heart, and dealt deceitfully ſix times, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 29. then the Lord threatned to pour out all his Plagues upon his heart, he would puniſh his acquired hardneſs with judicial hardneſs, and would withdraw thoſe Influences of his Spirit that ſhould ſoften him, leave him to the perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own heart, and to follow his own Counſel to his deſtruction. Now, though I might largely ſhew you the invalidity of your Opinion, as it croſſeth ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Attributes of God; God doth not make Decrees contrary to his own Nature, nor ſimply according to his own Will; but works all things according to the Counſel of his own Will: So that in whatſoever God doth, we are not only to look for Will, but Counſel, Wiſdom, and ſuch things as tend to Ends worthy of him; God's Will always
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35591:19"/> follows his Nature. The Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 13. God cannot deny himſelf, yet give me leave to give you two Reaſons why I cannot aſſent to your Opinion, that God of his meer Pleaſure did from all Eternity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to glorify his Soveraignty, in the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rejection and Damnation of the greateſt part of Mankind: I will be ſhort, becauſe I would willingly put an end to this Diſcourſe at this time.</p>

                  <p>Then, my firſt Reaſon is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Man had a Being from Eternity; nothing having been from Eternity but God: and therefore, in true Propriety of Speech, Men cannot be ſaid to be Reprobated but in time; 'tis true, the Law, or Decree of God, whereby Men come in time to be reprobated, was from Eternity: God from Eternity did decree, that all thoſe that live and die in a State of Impenitency ſhould periſh; but this Decree takes hold of Perſons in time, when they come to be actually diſobedient to the Lord: As the Lord ſaid to <hi>Moſes, he which ſinneth againſt me, him will I blot out of my Book.</hi> Therefore if nothing be Eternal but God, and if that be a truth, that whatſoever is in God, is God himſelf; then if God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned or reprobated any from Eternity, it muſt be himſelf; or elſe we muſt ſay, that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35591:19"/> Man was Co-eternal with God, and ſo give the Glory and Honour, which is due to God alone, to a poor contemptible Creature.</p>

                  <p>Yea, and as all Men were ſingly one in him, they were all alike holy, innocent, and free from blame, and ſo all alike beloved of him; all being yet nothing but himſelf: Nay, if we conſider all Mens State in <hi>Adam,</hi> while he was ſtanding Juſt and Righteous in that State, none of Mankind could be the Object of God's Hatred, but of his Love; and I hope you will not deny but we were in him, while he ſtood in a State of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as well as when in a State of Sin; and therefore, none reprobated when they never had ſinned, nor were capable of ſinning; for they could not ſin before they had a Being in the Fleſh, and man had no being in the Fleſh from Eternity: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that if God propoſed from Eternity to appoint to Everlaſting Miſery Millions of Men, it muſt be whilſt they were nothing but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>My ſecond Reaſon is, if God from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of his meer Pleaſure, did decree to glorify his Soveraignty in the Eternal Rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Damnation of the greateſt part of Mankind, and that when they were inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35591:20"/> and harmleſs (as above) he muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity deſtinate them unto Sin alſo; for where there is no Sin, there Puniſhment can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtly take place: For if a Man be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined to Damnation, he muſt unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſin, elſe he could not be damn'd; by this you make God the Author of Sin.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35591:20"/> whatſoever, that fall out in any time or place, but they are all the effect of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's Decrees. What Diſhonour is done to the God of Love by ſuch Doctrines as theſe, that he ſhould appoint, ordain, and unavoidably decree, to make the greateſt part of the World eternally miſerable; and that he might accompliſh his ends, did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate them to do Evil, drawing them on from Sin to Sin, till they had filled up the Meaſure of their Iniquitys, that ſo he might inflict upon them that Vengeance which he had provided for them; this is contrary to his revealed Will: <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>Thou art a God that hath no Pleaſure in Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs;</hi> and <hi>James</hi> 1. 13, 14. <hi>Let no Man ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted of God, for God tempts no Man;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> tells us, that the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, is not of the Father, but of the World: Surely God doth not uſe to neceſſitate that which his Soul abhors, and which he not only forbids in his Word, but alſo is the Condemner of it. Saith one of the Antients, to wit, <hi>Proſper,</hi> (vid. <hi>God's Love to Mankind,</hi> p. 50.) 'Tis againſt Reaſon to ſay, that he that is the Damner of the Devil would have any to be his Servants; what, do you think that God Almighty doth ſo delight in the Blood and Ruin of Men, that rather than not deſtroy them Soul and Body, he will have them live and die in Sin, that he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35591:21"/> may deſtroy them? This is like that which <hi>Suetonius</hi> reports of <hi>Tyberius,</hi> (in <hi>God's Love to Mankind, Page</hi> 59.) who being minded to put certain Virgins to death, becauſe it was againſt the Roman Laws to ſtrangle Virgins, cauſed them all to be defloured by the Hangman, that ſo they might be ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled; but far be any ſuch thing from the God of Truth, and Father of Mercy, that he ſhould appoint that the Devil ſhould lead Men into Sin, that afterward he might take occaſion to damn them for it.</p>

                  <p>This is no good Diſtinction: How much better had it been for the World, and what Peace might the Church of God have enjoyed, had People contented themſelves with what was ſpoken to them from the Lord, and had not given their Imagination ſuch unbounded Scope, as to peſter the World with ſuch abundance of Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Diſtinctions, and frivolous Niceties. Now I readily grant, that it was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Will of God to redeem loſt Man, by the delivering up of his Son unto Death; that is, by leaving him in the Hands, and to the Will of thoſe who were his Enemies, and whom the Lord did foreknow would put him to Death, unleſs he did interpoſe by his Power, to prevent their Rage and Malice. Now for the effecting of this great and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Work, the Redemption and Salvation of Mankind, it was ſufficient for God to decree, that in caſe theſe, or any other ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt his Death, he would not hinder them from effecting it: but neither this Scripture, nor any other ſaith, that the Hand and Counſel of God had determined, that the Jews and Gentiles ſhould betray and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt; but only that theſe were gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together to effect that which God in his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35591:22"/> Counſel had determined before to be done, <hi>(to wit)</hi> the Redemption of the World. Compare this Text with <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 23. where the Apoſtle plainly lays this Sin upon their own Heads; in that they took, and by wicked Hands cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified and ſlew the Lord of Life and Glory. <hi>Du-Veil</hi> commenting upon this place, ſaith, <q rend="inline">That this Jeſus, by the Decree of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to whom he in all things voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obeyed, being ſurrendred into your Hands, with incredible Importunity you forced the Romans to nail to a Croſs:—Therefore, Chriſt by the determinate Decree of God, was given up into the power and diſpoſal of his Enemies, whoſe hoſtile and inhuman Rage God did not predeſtinate, but only foreknew.</q> Now, tho God did decree to leave his Son in the Hands of wicked Men, that ſo he might die for Sin; yet it is no leſs than Wickedneſs and horrid Blaſphemy, to ſay that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that ſuch and ſuch Men by Name, ſhould betray and murder him: Now, to kill a holy and innocent Perſon is a ſinful Act, which is not from God, but of the Devil, who is the Author of it, <hi>John</hi> 8. 40, 43, 44. and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 13. 2. that the devil put it in <hi>Judas</hi>'s Heart to betray Chriſt; and that <hi>Judas</hi> fell by Tranſgreſſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 25. Now if God, who hath by his Word prohibited the ſhedding of Blood, or taking of any Man's Life away unjuſtly, ſhould any
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35591:22"/> way incline or compel Men to it, ſo as to lay them under a Neceſſity of being wicked, he muſt needs be the Author of it. Biſhop <hi>

                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe in wicked Actions the Acts themſelves are ſimply Sin; as <hi>Adam</hi>'s eating the forbidden Fruit was ſimply Sin: and is not Murder, Drunkenneſs, profane Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Stealing, Whoring, in themſelves Sin?

What God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees muſt neceſſarily come to paſs; but it muſt come to paſs in the ſame manner that he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees it, which is as it ſhall be in reſpect of time.

God's fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg of this, or the other Man's Sins from Eternity, doth infer, that theſe his Sins would be committed; for God cannot be deceived: yet his fore-knowledg that Man would ſin, hath no influence upon his Sin, which ſhews Man's Deſtruction to be of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35591:24"/> he doth not decree it: It cannot be thought but God did foreknow that the Jews would mock his Meſſengers, deſpiſe his Word, miſuſe his Prophets, till his Wrath aroſe againſt them, till there was no Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; yet did not he decree it, but ſent his Meſſengers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in true love to them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 15, 16. God Almighty, thro the Infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Wiſdom and Knowledg, is able infallibly to know and foreſee all Mens Ways and Actions, and what they will be from the beginning of the World, to the end thereof, as well, nay, far better than Man doth, when his days are finiſhed; being without all poſſibility of Error or Miſtake: yet this fore-knowledg of this or the other coming to paſs, doth not cauſe a neceſſity that it ſhall ſo come to paſs, no more than my fore-knowledg that Men will die, is a cauſe of their Death. Without all queſtion, God foreknew that <hi>Herod</hi> would ſeek the young Child Jeſus to deſtroy him; and in all probability, had Jeſus been in the coaſt of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> at that time, when <hi>Herod</hi>'s bloody Inquiſition was put in Execution, Jeſus had died; that the Lord foreſaw, and therefore warned <hi>Joſeph</hi> to take the young Child and flee into <hi>Egypt.</hi> But very full to our purpoſe is that in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 11, 12. where <hi>David</hi> inquires of the Lord, if <hi>Saul</hi> would come down to <hi>Keilah,</hi> and the Lord ſaid he would come down; and that the Lords of <hi>Keilah</hi>

                     <hi>Job</hi> 35. 6, 7. But a Word with reſpect to the term Fore-knowledg, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in ſeveral places attributes unto God, tho held by Learned and good Chriſtians to be an unproper Term, and attributed to God, as the Parts and Paſſions of a Man are; as Hands, Eyes, Ears, Grief, Joy, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Holy Ghoſt is pleaſed to uſe ſuch vulgar Terms, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to our Capacity, that ſo we might receive ſome Light of God's Eternal Workings, and might be inriched with ſuch Conceptions and Knowledg of him as we are capable of. Now with reſpect to us that are temporal, we ſay, that God Almighty doth foreſee, and foreknow us, and predeſtinate us; yet we muſt not think, that God's Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are Eternal, muſt be wrought like ours in time. This was to raiſe ſuch Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in us, which are unworthy of him, and not conſiſtent with the truth of his Being: for this is adjudg'd for a Truth by the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that God wills nothing in time. Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> in his Commentary upon <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 40, ſpeaking of God's Fore-knowledg, ſaith, That to ſoreſee, is aſcribed to God, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, but in regard of our Capacity; for if we ſpeak of God properly, God cannot be ſaid to foreſee any thing; becauſe all things be preſent to him, whether paſt, or to come. Dr. <hi>Moulins,</hi> upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. as quoted by <hi>De-Laun,</hi> in his <hi>Sec. Philo, page</hi> 70. God is ſaid to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know ſuch which he foreſaw would believe in

Now, if God wills nothing in time, neither doth he foreknow, or foreſee any thing in time; his Fore-knowledg being as Antient as himſelf, even from Eternity: ſo that with God, there is no Word nor Thought, nor Actions, paſt or to come, but are all at once with God, even in one eternal preſent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 2. yea, our Birth, our Lives, our Death, our Election and Predeſtination, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 18. are all at once with God, <hi>with whom is no variableneſs or ſhadow of changing,</hi> Heb. 13. 8.

Let us then here learn to become Fools, that we may be wiſe, and leave prying into thoſe things, which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our human Reaſon to conceive, and let us keep cloſe to God's revealed Will, which is our Duty; for the want of this hath fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

So that what if God did foreknow all the wicked Actions of Men before they came to paſs, yet might not God as well foreknow, that if they had but improved thoſe Means which he through his Grace had afforded them, they might not have come to paſs? for the fore-knowledg in God of what Men will do, doth not imply any abſolute neceſſity of their doing of it; neither have they any leſs Power to refrain doing of it, becauſe of God's fore-knowing that they will do it. Whilſt it remained, ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Ananias</hi> touching his Poſſeſſion, was it not thy own? <hi>i.e.</hi> wert thou not at full liberty to have kept it for thy own private uſe? and when it was ſold, was it not in thy Power, <hi>viz.</hi> whether thou wouldſt part with thy Money or not?

                  <p>I ſee you can play faſt and looſe with your Opinion; ſometimes you ſay that God did from Eternity freely and unchangeably ordain whatſoever comes to paſs; and when by this Doctrine you find that Man is laid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:35591:27"/> a neceſſity of ſinning, and conſequently God becomes the Author of all the wicked Actions of Men, then you would help your ſelf, by ſaying, Though Man ſin not by the operative decree of God, yet he doth by the permiſſive decree. This is no more indeed, than what we find and hear in the Sermons of all thoſe of your way; when they preach on this Subject, the Doctrinal part of their Sermons countenance one thing, and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatory part that which is contrary unto it; labouring to beget ſuch a Faith in their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, as would deſtroy the Faith of their Doctrine. What wooing and beſeeching doth your Miniſters make for Sinners to cloſe with Chriſt, to repent, believe, and obey the Lord, and not to withſtand the Day of Grace? when yet notwithſtanding all this, they believe there is no Grace nor Mercy, but for very few before them; and that their ſtrongeſt Endeavours to repent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> effect juſt nothing, but the over-ruling Decree of God doth all; and ſo they pull down with one hand, what they build up with the other. And the Truth is, this Doctrine of God's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal decreeing the greateſt part of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Offspring to Sin and Damnation, includes in it ſo many Abſurdities, horrible Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, undermining the very Foundation of all Religion and Piety, that my Hopes are, that it will ſhortly fall, with the unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable weight of its own Evil. Yea, were
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35591:27"/> it not for ſo many Volumes written to uphold it, I ſhould hope it would appear ſo wicked, that all good Chriſtians e're long would be aſhamed to own it; and God's Love to all would be exalted in the Hearts, Tongues, and Writings of all Men. One thing I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is the cauſe why this Doctrine doth ſo flouriſh and lift up its Head in this Day, is an over-much confiding in Perſons, of whoſe Learning and Piety they have had a high Opinion. This draws many ignorant, tho well-meaning Hearers, to be zealous in what they teach, be it right or wrong, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Perſons, reputed Godly and Learned, more than the pure unerring Word of God: Alas! all good and pious Men have Errors and Fits of Diſtempers, thro human Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and we ought not to take their Words up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on truſt, but upon trial, and in thoſe things that appertain to Salvation, bring them to the Law and Teſtimony; and to ſuſpect that for Truth, where the Word of God admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters much more Ground to doubt and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than believe, as this Doctrine of perſonal and reſpective Reprobation doth.</p>
                  <p>But a word to the permiſſive Decree of God. If by the permiſſive Decree of God, you mean that God permitting, or ſuffering ſuch, or ſuch a thing to be done, or come to paſs, ſuppoſeth a neceſſity of the coming of it to paſs: This I deny; for if it be true, that a Sparrow falls not to the Ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35591:28"/> his Permiſſion, yet hath not he decreed eternally, that it ſhall be at ſuch or ſuch a time, or in any cruel way, as it often falls out directly contrary to his Will, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 6. and though it be a Truth, God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to ſuffer Sin, otherwiſe there could be none; yet it is alſo a great Truth, that this permiſſive Decree of God is no cauſe of Sin. God doth permit one Man to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Life of another; but it doth not follow, that therefore he did appoint, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain them to ſuch wicked Actions: No De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, that is purely, and barely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive, either induceth, or ſuppoſeth any neceſſity of the coming to paſs what is ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed; no more than a Capital Law neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates to Murder: Permiſſion ſuppoſeth a Poſſibility of ſinning, or not ſinning, in the Party permitted. From whence I conclude, there is no damning to Miſery, without rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Sin; for it is Sin, as Sin, and in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conſideration, is the Cauſe of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſurely, God being moſt pure, perfect, and Goodneſs it ſelf, cannot be a Cauſe, either Moral or Phyſical, of that which is nothing but Deficiency. If any of us miſs Happineſs, let us not fooliſhly and ſawcily charge God with our Ruin, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights not in it, but rather upon our ſelves. And I pray take heed, while you diſlike Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi>'s Phraſe, you hold not to his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for then would you make God worſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:35591:28"/> than the Devil, becauſe the Devil doth only tempt and perſwade to Sin, and his Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be reſiſted; for it is granted on all Hands, the Devil can but allure, not compel to Sin. But by this Opinion, God doth not only will Sin, but procure it by a powerful and effectual Decree: This is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God's revealed Will, but alſo fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt all the Attributes of God, which I might largely ſhew. Surely 'tis Mens wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſinning, which renders every Caſt-away liable to Reprobation, and no fore-determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God neceſſitates him thereunto; as you may ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 11, 12. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21, 24. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 11. Thoſe that are here left to themſelves, are the obſtinate and wilful Sinners, which hate Inſtruction, and ſcorn Mercy, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24. And ſaith <hi>Hockins,</hi> on <hi>God's Decree,</hi> p. 44. <q rend="inline">All Men do by their Sins and Iniquities tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprobate themſelves; ſo that eternal Deſtruction becomes Mens choice, not their unhappy Deſtiny; and our Miſery, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive its Original, not from God, but our own Wills: ſo that we need not ſeek for any hidden Cauſe, but our own ſecret and open Impieties.</q> And indeed for my part, I cannot find that God hath neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated any to be wicked, and thereby juſtly miſerable; but hath graciouſly provided Means, whereby both Sin and Miſery might be prevented or removed, if timely imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35591:29"/> But I ſhall ſay no more at this time, for I ſee it grows late; but I could heartily wiſh we might have a little farther Diſcourſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo it may be in Love.</p>

I alſo freely grant, that whatſoever God hath revealed in his Word, muſt needs be a Truth, and meet and worthy to be believed of us all: But where do you find, that God hath revealed in his Word,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:35591:32"/> that he hath appointed the greateſt part of the World to Everlaſting Miſery? and tho there may be many things above Reaſon quite out of the Apprehenſion of it, yet not altogether againſt Reaſon. How is it contrary to Reaſon, that God the firſt Being of all things, being Infinite, ſhould have a manner of ſubſiſting far different from all created and finite Beings? Neither is it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Reaſon, that God ſhould be able to make a Virgin to conceive in a way beyond the Courſe of Nature, or ordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for the accompliſhing of ſo great and glorious a Work, as the ſaving poor loſt and undone Mankind. Neither ought it to be look'd upon, no, not in the Eye of Reaſon, as a thing incredible, that God ſhould raiſe the Dead, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 8. Is it not every way as eaſy for God to reſtore a Body diſſolved to Duſt, and give a Perfection and Glory to it, as to reſtore a dry Hand to Life and Activity in the Body, or cauſe <hi>Aaron</hi>'s dry Staff to bloſſom and bare Almonds? Can Man burn a Tree into Aſhes, and change it into ſhining Glaſs? And cannot God cauſe that Duſt that was once Fleſh, to become Fleſh again, and to reſtore it to a Spiritual, Immortal, and Incorruptible State?

But ſurely God never left any Man in that State whereunto <hi>Adam</hi> brought him; but as I have ſaid, hath gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly provided means whereby both Sin and Miſery might be prevented, or removed, if timely embraced, ſeeing Chriſt hath abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed that Wrath and Death, and hath brought Life and Immortality to light by the Goſpel; and God hath ſo far reconciled all Sinners to himſelf, that thro the Sacrifice, and for the ſake of that Lamb of God that takes away the Sins of the World, he is graciouſly pleaſed to be reconciled to them, and to open a Door of Hope for all the Sons of <hi>Adam.</hi> And tho it is a great Truth that <hi>Adam,</hi> in breaking the Law of his God, brought not only himſelf,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:35591:33"/> but all his Poſterity (if he ſhould have had any) under Sentence of Death and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; yet did the Lord, who delights in Mercy, before he pronounc'd the Sentence due to him for Sin, graciouſly promiſe a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. by which he was put into a ſtate of Recovery from this dreadful Fall: And God by this gracious Promiſe took whole <hi>Adam</hi> into Grace and Favour.

For unleſs Perſons will take to themſelves a lawleſs Liberty, to exerciſe Dominion over the Expreſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, they cannot make them greater or leſſer in one Clauſe than in the other: for if Condemnation ſhould come upon all Men by the offence of <hi>Adam,</hi> and Righteouſneſs only upon ſome few by the Obedience of Chriſt; then where Sin abounded, Grace ſhould not ſuper-abound, as <hi>Verſe</hi> 20. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Grace hath a proportionable Reign unto Life, (ſo as to put all Men into a Capacity of Life and Salvation) as Sin reigned over all Men without exception unto Death.</p>

                  <p>The Apoſtle's Scope is to ſhew, that as Death came in by one publick Perſon, ſo Life and Salvation came in by another pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Perſon; and that the Lord Jeſus will infallibly juſtify and ſave his All, for whom he undertook, and died as their Head and Repreſentative.</p>

                  <p>But it ſeems you will not own, that the Grace of Chriſt did profit Mankind, as much as the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> damnified it: No, you make Chriſt leſs than <hi>Adam;</hi> and that <hi>Adam</hi> did more to the damning of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:35591:34"/> Souls and Bodies of all his Poſterity, than Chriſt did for the ſaving of them; if ſo, what will become of <hi>Paul</hi>'s glorying over the Grace of God in Chriſt, as much more abounding? as in <hi>Verſe</hi> 15. <hi>For if thro the offence of one, many be dead, much more the Grace of God, and the Gift by Grace, which is by one Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto many.</hi> But now if many more Millions of Men are dead, thro the offence of <hi>Adam</hi> than are made alive by the Grace of God in Chriſt, where's the <hi>much more?</hi>

                  <p>Now you run upon a Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Miſtake, about perſonal and abſolute Election and Reprobation: You make <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s Sin the Foundation of building your fearful Opinion upon; that Man ſuffers E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Damnation for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin. This is a moſt ſad Doctrine, that God ſhould lay men under a neceſſity of being born under
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:35591:35"/> the Guilt of that Sin, which was out of their Power to help or withſtand, (for men can no more help <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, than they could help being born) and yet for that, caſt away the greateſt part of Mankind for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; Shall one Man ſin, and will the Lord be wrath with all? <hi>Num.</hi> 16. 22. 'Tis true, when Man by diſobedience became Bankrupt of the Divine Bounty, and had run himſelf ſo far in Debt, both to the Law and Juſtice, beyond any poſſibility to pay the Debt, the Lord in Juſtice might have left him in the Fall, and made him Partaker of his fierce Wrath: Yet was the Lord pleaſed to break forth in high and much Mercy, and in the tenderneſs of his Love, deeply com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionating Man's Miſery, entered into a Covenant of Peace, freely giving his only Son to ſatisfy the whole Debt, and ſet us free; (for which we are obliged to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly thankful to our dear Lord, and truly to love him that firſt loved us) and hath promiſed, that whoſoever believes in him ſhall not periſh, but have Everlaſting Life. God hath now tied himſelf by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and hath firmly indented with us in the Covenant of Grace and Mercy, through Chriſt, that if we believe and obey the Lord, we ſhall undoubtedly reap the bleſſed Fruits of the Promiſe in Eternal Life. Therefore I beſeech you, do not entertain ſuch dreadful Apprehenſions of an Infinite
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:35591:35"/> Gracious God, that he ſhould ſend Millions of Men to endleſs torments for <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſingle Tranſgreſſion. Surely, if it was ſo, the Holy Ghoſt, who ſo effectually in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Truth vindicates the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Equity of God's Proceedings in the Condemnation of wicked and ungodly Men, would have inſiſted more or leſs upon it; we ſhould find ſomething of it in the Word of God, either from Chriſt, or ſome of his Servants; but I cannot find the leaſt hint of it in the whole Scripture, that ever the Lord decreed to aſſign Men their Portions with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils for that Sin, it being taken away (as to the condemning Guilt of it) by the Grace of God in Chriſt. Where doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſay, that for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin in eating the forbidden Fruit, God hateth the greateſt part of his Poſterity? yea, ſo hates them, as to reprobate them to the ſecond Death? but plainly tells us, the Child ſhall not ſuffer for the Father's Sins, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:35591:36"/> this doth not ſhew that God will condemn any for that offence which they never did in their own perſons, eſpecially when ſatisfied for it by their Surety.

                  <p>Deny Original ſin, no; but I do believe that all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the Glory of God, and that by reaſon of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, Death reigneth over all, of which none is free, being all concluded in unbelief, and corrupted in the original. <hi>Adam,</hi> when he was firſt created, was ſaid to be made in the Image of God; which Image did not only ſtand in having Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:35591:37"/> over the Creatures, as ſome of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients have expounded it, neither as if the Soul was of the ſubſtance of God; but the Image of God, in which <hi>Adam</hi> was created, was in Knowledg, Righteouſneſs and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 14. indued with all Perfection which was requiſite for a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſufficiently furniſhed with neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Wiſdom, Mercy, Juſtice, Patience, Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Love, Humility, and ſuch like; that ſo they might, in ſome meaſure, hold forth the Divine Perfection and Majeſty of God, and know how to uſe aright their Dominion and Sovereignty over all the inferior Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and alſo might underſtand the Will of God towards themſelves, that ſo they might render that Obedience which was due unto God, as their ſupreme Lord and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, whereby they might have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever happy and bleſſed. But now Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tempted to ſin, ſoon yielded to the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, loſt the Perfection of his Nature, his Holineſs, and pure Innocence, which was the condition of his Bleſſedneſs; in diſſolving of which he loſt his Happineſs, and was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out from the preſence of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now fallen from a moſt glorious condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Creation, unto the miſerable ſtate of Corruption; in which State of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 3. That <hi>Adam begot a Child in his own lineneſs;</hi> it doth not ſay that he begat a Son in the Image of God
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:35591:37"/> (in which he was created) but in the Image of himſelf, that is in the ſame condition of himſelf, at that time of Generation. Had <hi>Adam</hi> begotten Children before he fell, he had begotten a Righteous Seed, after the Image of his Perfection, becauſe the Image of God in him was unpolluted; but begetting Children after the Depravation of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Stream could not riſe purer than the Fountain; none could bring a clean thing out of an unclean one. And though all, with reſpect of what was derived unto them from <hi>Adam,</hi> are wholly loſt, and in the ſtrictneſs of Juſtice worthy of eternal Death, yet the guilt of it (as to eternal Death) is taken away by the abounding Grace of God, vouchſafed to the World by Jeſus Chriſt; which extends it ſelf to all that were loſt in <hi>Adam.</hi>

                  <p>You cannot prove that that Death which was threatened to <hi>Adam,</hi> if he diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed the Lord, was Damnation to Hell-fire; neither if the Promiſe of Chriſt had not been made, whether <hi>Adam</hi> had lived to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Children or not, or whether he had not

'Tis no better than ſinful cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, to be too confident in ſuch unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed matters: 'tis the ſafeſt way to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and to go no farther than the Scriptures guide us; and where the Holy Ghoſt hath not a Pen to write, let us not have a Tongue to ſpeak: God hath revealed enough to make us wiſe to Salvation. Yet this I ſay, that whatſoever State <hi>Adam</hi> was in, there was all Mankind with him, there was a time (if Eternity may be called ſo) when all Men conſidered as in God, were nothing but God himſelf; according to that Maxim, <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in God, is God.</hi> All Men had a being in God, before they had a being in <hi>Adam, Luk.</hi> 3. 38. where <hi>Adam</hi> is called the Son of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. There was a time, when <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo all Men in him, was righteous and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as during his State of pure Innocency.

                  <p n="3">3dly.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:35591:38"/> thoſe that have not ſinned after the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4thly.

And I ſuppoſe you will not ſay, but God pardoned this Sin in <hi>Adam,</hi> upon the account of Chriſt; and if he pardon him, who freely acted it in his own Perſon, do you think he will ſend others to Hell for it?

                  <p>What; did not Chriſt take away the original Guilt from none? What, the the Elect which were taken into the Love and Favour of God before the Foundation of the World, yet Children of Wrath by Birth? What, did not Chriſt take it away from them?</p>
                  <p>Pray take heed you charge not the human Nature with a Sin, where God hath not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of doing him the greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thereby, tho in the main, it layeth to the Lord's charge the chief Cauſe of all Evils. Surely by Nature here, cannot be meant our Deſcent from <hi>Adam,</hi> by partaking of the human Nature. For where do you find, that the Wrath of God is entailed upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity, as they are Men? but as they are vitious and ſinful, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 6. by reaſon of their actual Sins, <hi>comes the Wrath of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Children of Diſobedience.</hi> You never find the Judgments of God threatned to any for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, nor againſt the human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:35591:39"/> as if the very Eſſence and Being of a Man was the Object of God's Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now, as our National Laws lay no Penalty upon a Child that is gotten in Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, becauſe it partakes of the Nature of a Man, (in this caſe, the Child is by all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted as innocent, not worthy of any Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; it being a thing quite out of its Power to help, and ſo quite out of the reach of Penal Laws, which are inflicted upon thoſe that are Criminals:) and ſo it is in Divine. I will give you three Reaſons why I cannot take this Scripture in your ſenſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. Becauſe we do not find, that the word <hi>Nature</hi> in Scripture, ſignifies Conception, or natural Birth; neither is it mentioned as a thing that is ſinful in it ſelf in being born.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. If by <hi>Nature</hi> be meant our Deſcent from <hi>Adam,</hi> and by <hi>Wrath</hi> be meant to be ſo under the Diſpleaſure of God, as to deſerve Hell, notwithſtanding what Chriſt hath done for them, then I cannot ſee, but all dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infants muſt periſh eternally; for they cannot be born again by Faith in Chriſt, and yet they muſt have Salvation by him, or not at all, and how they ſhould have it by him, but as he was the Lamb of God that taketh away the Sin of the World, I do not know: for ſurely Chriſt hath brought a greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to human Nature, than the Loſs it ſuſtained by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin.</p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:35591:40"/>
                  <p n="3">3dly. If Nature was ſo vile a thing as you would have it, Chriſt would never have taken our Nature upon him, for he was in all Points like unto us, Sin only excepted. Now, if all that are conceived and born, be by their Birth, Children of Wrath; then, why was not Chriſt under it alſo, for his Fleſh was the ſame with ours?</p>

                  <p>But he was conceived by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt in a wonderful manner, without the help of Man: had he taken Fleſh by a carnal Generation, he had been polluted with Sin as well as others.</p>

                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>What, tho he was formed in the Womb of the Virgin, ſo as to be without carnal Generation; yet it was not without her Conception, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 31. I hope I need not tell you how dangerous it is to believe, that Chriſt paſſed through the Virgin, as Water through a Spout, without partaking of her Subſtance. But ſurely he took Fleſh, not only in, but of the Virgin; and was as really <hi>David</hi>'s Son and his Offspring, as he was <hi>David</hi>'s Root and <hi>David</hi>'s Lord. So that I think it's no more Sin in us in being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and born of our Mothers Subſtance, than it was for Chriſt to be formed of his Mother's Subſtance. And I ſuppoſe, that what was <hi>Adam</hi>'s perſonal Sin, was not the Affection of an univerſal Nature; nor can you prove there was the conſent of human Nature to it, but meerly of <hi>Adam.</hi> Now,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:35591:40"/> where there is no conſent or acting, there could be no Tranſgreſſion; Tranſgreſſion is the Breach of a Law, of which Nature may not be guilty, when Perſons are.</p>

                  <p>Why then are we not guilty of all other Sins which <hi>Adam</hi> committed after, as well as the firſt? yea, of all the Sins of our Progenitors, ſince we were in their Loins, as well as in <hi>Adam</hi>'s: So that yet this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not prove what you bring it for; it doth not prove that any deſerves Hell and Damnation by Birth, nor can it favour or ſupport that horrible Doctrine of God's po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive and abſolute Rejection of Men for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin: but this Scripture is better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of thoſe that ſin againſt the Law of Nature, which the God of Nature, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his divine Will, hath placed in them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14. which Light diſcovers Sin, reproves, yea, judges and condemns for Sin: <hi>If our Hearts condemn us,</hi> &amp;c. and tho the Light ſet up in them, the Law written in their Hearts, did flaſh Wrath in their Faces, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences accuſing them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. yet they abuſed the Light, or Law of Nature, living
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35591:41"/> in Sin and Diſobedience, and ſo were by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Children of Wrath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo are all that come to act Sin; but no Perſons by Birth are thus the Children of Wrath, nor none out of the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Adam,</hi> till they come to abuſe the Grace of the Covenant: For God hates none till they firſt hate him, leaves none till they firſt forſake him, makes none Partakers of Everlaſting Burning, till they kindle his Wrath by their actual Sins; for he doth not ſo delight in the Blood of Souls, as by his pure and naked Will, to decree Man to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Death, before they enjoy any Life, or commit the leaſt Sin. Infants are accounted Innocent; and our Saviour tells us, 'tis not the Will of his Father that any of thoſe little ones periſh.</p>

                  <p>This is a ſtrange aſſertion, to ſay, That all Infants come into World in a ſtate of Innocency; and that if they die in Infancy, they die in a ſtate of Innocency: Alas! there is a univerſal depravedneſs in the Soul of an Infant, which if it live to expreſs it, will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it ſelf. A young Cub of a Fox or Wolf doth not preſently diſcover its rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous nature, but it is inherent in it, bred with it, and Men kill thoſe young Cubs, though they never did any miſchief, becauſe it is their natures to be ravenous and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous: So an Infant hath the Seed of all Sin, a corrupt Nature, though it doth
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:35591:41"/> not act as it doth when Age comes on; and I ſay, God may for the guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, and becauſe there is ſuch Rebellion and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Man's nature againſt him, glorifie his Juſtice upon them; though they ſhould die in their Infancy, they are far from dying in Innocency.</p>

                  <p>It ſeems by what you hold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Man may ſlaughter Beaſts of Prey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any cruelty or injuſtice, therefore God may as well, nay more, appoint as many of poor Infants to the Torments of Hell, if he pleaſeth, and yet be juſt and good notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: May we not as well reaſon thus? God without any injuſtice, appointed brute Creatures to be ſlain for Man's uſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he may ordain Men to be caſt into Hell Torments for ever. Though God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, nay appointeth Man to ſlaughter Beaſts, that they might be Meat for his uſe, and ſo giveth him power to kill them; yet it would be look'd upon barbarous injuſtice and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to prolong the Life of a Beaſt to vex and torture it, to ſhew what Power and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty he hath over it. So I do not doubt, but God may, when he pleaſes, take away the Life of an Infant, or Man; yea, reſolve them to nothing, without any cruelty or injuſtice: Yet he cannot without both theſe, decree to keep them alive in Hell, there to torment them without end, to ſhew his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, without juſt cauſe in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

                  <p>This was only to a Temporal Death; I hope you will not ſay that it was the Decree of God, after <hi>Saul</hi> had deſtroy'd thoſe Infants and Sucklings Bodies, that he would ſend their Souls to Hell for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers faults; ſure it was not the ſin of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35591:43"/> that cauſed the Lord to plead in ſuch wrath with them, no more than the Cattle which was to be deſtroy'd as well as they; Was God offended with the Beaſts of the Field? But come, I believe it was no unjuſt thing in God, to take away by Death thoſe Infants and Sucklings, no more than to take away by Death many thouſands which daily die through the World; for Death reigns over all, and when Infants are taken away, either by a Natural Death, or in any cruel manner, 'tis for Sin, even that of <hi>Adam</hi>'s; yea, many times their own Parents Sin ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens the Death of the Child: and in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, very often the Children ſuffer for the Father's fault; not only in the good things of this Life, but alſo Death it ſelf, as in the Old World, and in the overthrow of <hi>Sodom;</hi> and are ſlain with the Sword as in this Caſe, and likewiſe in thoſe common Calamities which have befallen Nations and Cities. But what, will any one dare to ſay that ſuch Infants and Sucklings are damned? Who can forbear trembling at ſuch a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conceit? And ſurely you that hold than Infants have ſin enough from <hi>Adam</hi> to damn them to Hell, had need bring good Scripture-proof for ſuch a dreadful Doctrine.

                  <p>Why, only their Teachers whom they admire have drawn them into a diſlike of the Truth of God, by putting the Name of Ignominy and Reproach upon them: What tho the Papiſts hold univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and are ſo unhappy to hold this part of Truth in unrighteouſneſs?

                  <p>I know it is concluded from this Text, that <hi>Eſau</hi> in Perſon was damned; but this is but Mens Raſhneſs and Preſumption; there is not the leaſt Syllable in all the word of God (that I know of) for Perſons to ground ſuch a Belief, or from whence to draw ſuch a dreadful Concluſion, that <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhould be damned eternally. Love and Hatred in this Text may be with reſpect to Temporal Bleſſings; and ſo <hi>Eſau</hi> may be ſaid to be hated, and <hi>Jacob</hi> loved, becauſe to <hi>Jacob</hi> was given the fruitful Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and to <hi>Eſau</hi> was given the barren Country of <hi>Mount Seir:</hi> Or Love and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred may be with reſpect to Chriſt, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Seed; and ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> was ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated or ſanctified, to be the Fore-father of Chriſt according to the Fleſh; and <hi>Eſau,</hi> with reſpect to that rejected, and ſo was but a common or profane Perſon. (Now this was one end of Circumciſion, to diſtinguiſh
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:35591:46"/> the Family, of whom Chriſt ſhould be born, and to keep that People, of whom the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to come, unmixt from the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Nations.) Now <hi>Eſau</hi> very juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt that Bleſſing for ſelling his Birth-Right at ſo baſe a Price; for <hi>Eſau</hi> being the Elder of Right, the Bleſſing did belong to him; but he undervaluing of it, ſold it to his Brother: So that now the Bleſſing, as well as the Birth-Right, was his Brothers; and ſo after <hi>Iſaac</hi> had bleſſed <hi>Jacob, Eſau</hi> could by no Means cauſe his Father to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or reverſe his Bleſſing, tho he ſought it carefully with Tears, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 17. but ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 33. <hi>I have bleſſed him, and he ſhall be bleſſed,</hi> he could not recal it again. Yet this Rejection, as to his being the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from whom the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come, or with reſpect to temporal Bleſſings, gives no one Ground to aver, that he was reprobated, in reſpect to the Salvation of his Soul: or theſe Words might be ſpoken, with regard to what they would do in time, God certainly knew what <hi>Eſau</hi> would do in time, and might thereby ſhew what would in time be done unto him; or rather with reſpect to the Works of the Fleſh and the Spirit: <hi>Eſau</hi> being a Type of the one, and <hi>Jacob</hi> of the other; ſo the Works of the Spirit are pleaſing to God, and always beloved of him: and ſo the Works of the Fleſh are abominable to him; ſo that theſe two may

Where do you find, that <hi>Eſau</hi> was ſubſer vient to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob?</hi> but rather the contrary, <hi>Jacob</hi> calling <hi>Eſau</hi> Lord; ſo that this Text ſpeaks not of ſingle Perſons, but of Nations; and ſo the Love and Hatred there ſpoken of is National, as you may ſee by comparing this Verſe with <hi>Obadiah,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. 4. where the Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites are called <hi>Eſau,</hi> and the Jews <hi>Jacob:</hi> and the cauſe why the Lord hated the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Eſau,</hi> was for their Wickedneſs and

Now for the better underſtanding this <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. we muſt take notice what was the main thing the Apoſtle was carrying on: Now, the main thing that he was upon, was not to maintain abſolute and perſonal Election and Reprobation; this was not the way to convince the Jews of their Sin, in rejecting and crucifying the Lord of Life and Glory, and their ſlighting the Goſpel; for this would have been the way to eſtabliſh them in their Error, of being the only elect People in the World, becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, to whom the Promiſe was at firſt made; and therefore their State ſafe enough, tho they did not believe in Chriſt. And ſaith Mr. <hi>Loveday, p.</hi> 224. <q rend="inline">It is known for a Truth, that there was no People under Heaven more cordially principled in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Election than they: they took all but themſelves to be reprobated, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the Goſpel to be preached to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that they might be ſaved,</q> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 16. The Jews, the Elder Brother, could not bear to ſee the kindneſs ſhewed by the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:35591:47"/> Father to the Prodigal, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. Nay, <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf greatly queſtioned his Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of going to preach to the Gentiles, till convinced of it by a Viſion from Heaven, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. And when <hi>Peter</hi> came to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> they contended with him about his going and converſing with the Gentiles, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 1, 2. Yea, and for ſome time after the death of <hi>Stephen,</hi> many preached the Word of God to none but the Jews only. It appears, that notwithſtanding Chriſt had given a Commiſſion to preach the Goſpel to the whole World; yet they were ignorant of the calling of the Gentiles to partake of Mercy through Chriſt. Now if the Jews had underſtood, that perſonal Election and Reprobation had been the thing <hi>Paul</hi> was about to prove, they would never have quarrelled with him about it; for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that if any People in the World was beloved of God, it muſt needs be themſelves; for they above all other were choſen to be a peculiar People, and beloved for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſake, and unto them pertained the Adoption and the Glory, and the Covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 12. but this was not the Point, but the great Controverſy between <hi>Paul</hi> and the Jewiſh Rabbies, was about the Terms of Juſtification, whether by the Law, or by Faith; or upon what account a Sinner might be juſtified and ſaved; and who was the Perſon to whom the Bleſſing belonged.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:35591:48"/> Now the Apoſtles Buſineſs is to aſſert and maintain Juſtification and Salvation to come in by Chriſt alone, without the Works of the Law; and that there was an abſolute Neceſſity of believing in Jeſus Chriſt (where God hath afforded the Means) both by the Jews as well as Gentiles; which will appear, if you look <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 4. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 30. and in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 10. he ſhews, that a Man <hi>is not juſtified by the Works of the Law, but by Faith.</hi> And this he proves from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was not juſtified himſelf by Works, but by Faith; and tho the Jews boaſted much of their being <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Seed, yet he tells them <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed was many; one by <hi>Hagar,</hi> another by <hi>Sarah.</hi> Now if the Promiſe was made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, then <hi>Iſhmael</hi> as well as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> as well as <hi>Jacob</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited the Promiſe: but the Promiſe was not made to Seeds, as of many, but to a Seed; which Seed was thoſe that believe and walk in the ſteps of <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4. 12. Theſe, whether Jews or Gentiles, were tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and only to be the reputed Children of <hi>Abraham, Gal.</hi> 3. 7. and <hi>Heirs of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, Verſe</hi> 29. ſo that it is neither Birth nor Works was perferred by God, nor any thing ſhould be challenged by Birth or Works, but only through Faith in Chriſt; and ſo the Elder ſerve the Younger, that is, the Jews the Elder, which ſeek Salvation by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:35591:48"/> the Works of the Law, or according to the Fleſh, ſhall not have it; but the Gentiles, the Younger, who ſeek Salvation by the free Grace of God, through Faith in Chriſt, ſhall have it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 33, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that this Text proves not what you bring it for; neither can you fairly underſtand it of ſuch a Love or Hatred, as to prove either Perſons or Parties are ſaved or damned; much leſs doth it prove, that God hates any perſonally, conſidered as they are Sinners in <hi>Adam, &amp;c.</hi> Very well, ſaith Dr. <hi>Homes, p.</hi> 8. <q rend="inline">God caſt off none till they caſt off him,</q> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 16. <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 1.

                  <p>I am none of thoſe that pretend to keep the Keys of God's Secrets: I dare
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:35591:49"/> not ſay God never did, nor ever will chuſe any perſonally conſidered. But can it juſtly be concluded from God's predeſtianting, ſome, perſonally conſider'd, to Eternal Life, that therefore all the reſt were decreed abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to Condemnation, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their Diſobedience; any more than when a King, without any Condition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, pardons ſome that are guilty of the ſame Offence with others; that he thereby implys, that all the reſt (to whom he offers Pardon upon ſuch conditions as they were able to perform) ſhould be Executed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mercy? Neither do I ſee any grounds from theſe Scriptures, that we muſt needs underſtand Perſons under a perſonal conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, without reſpect to Faith in Chriſt, or any other Qualification, to be the object of Electing Love, and as ſuch ſhall infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enjoy Eternal Salvation; I know no Scripture that ſaith ſo, nor can any Man be ſaid to be choſen before the Foundation of the World, or from the Fall, any otherwiſe than in the Decree of God, which is brought forth in time, when they come actually to believe in Chriſt; for God calleth things that are not, as if they were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 7. and it is a uſual thing in Scripture to ſpeak of things to be done in time, as if already done; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. where the Apoſtle ſpeaks as if they were already glorified, yet not actually glorified, nor any otherwiſe,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:35591:50"/> than in the Purpoſe or Decree of God: and ſo 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. they are ſaid to be ſaved, who were not at that time actually ſaved; ſo in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4. they are ſaid to be choſen in him <hi>before the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World,</hi> though not choſen till they came to believe in Chriſt; for as Chriſt was called <hi>a Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World, Rev.</hi> 13. 8. though not ſlain till he took Fleſh upon him, which was ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Years after, even ſo Perſons are ſaid to be Elected from the Foundation of the World, though not choſen till they be in Chriſt; and when Perſons have once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Being in Chriſt by Faith, they may truly be ſaid to be Choſen, by virtue of that Decree of Election, which was in God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Foundation of the World, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he decreed to chuſe all thoſe to Salvation who ſhould repent of their Sins, believe in his Son, and be obedient to his Will; and when they come into this State, God may be ſaid to chuſe them before the Foundation of the World, by virtue of the Decree that was in him. So that whatſoever Elective Love God hath, or might have for any of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> more than for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Yet this is a thing, that wholly lies hid in the ſecret Counſel of God, and wholly unknown to us; but this the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reveals for a truth, That <hi>whomſoever God predeſtinates, them he calls, before they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:35591:50"/> juſtified or glorified,</hi> Rom. 8. 30. and ſo 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13. through Sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now if the Saints are choſen to Salvation through, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and were called to it by the Goſpel, then they were not choſen actually before they had believed the Truth, or before they heard the Goſpel. And to make this more plain, you know <hi>Paul</hi> was a choſen Veſſel, or a moſt choice Inſtrument, a Veſſel for the Lord's uſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 15. yet he tells us, that he was before a Blaſphemer, and a Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and Injurious, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. and writing to his Son <hi>Titus, ch.</hi> 3. 3. ſpeaking of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſaith, <hi>We our ſelves were ſometimes fooliſh, diſobedient, deceiving, ſerving divers Luſts and Pleaſures, living in Malice and Envy, bateful, and hating one another.</hi> Now ſhall we ſay that <hi>Paul</hi> during his unbelief and impenitence was in a juſtified State, an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted Child of God?

                  <p>I look upon this Speech of yours (that <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> during their unbelieving State, were as much in the love and favour of God as after) to be very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, and opens a gap for Men to run into all manner of Abomination; for if I once fancy my ſelf to be one of the Darlings of Heaven, one of the Elected ones, and that I cannot poſſibly ſin my ſelf out of the love of God, and that I am no nearer Salvation after I believe, than I was before; Why may not I take liberty to commit any crime? For it ſeems Heaven may be found in the way to Hell, and in the Service of Sin and Satan; I may fulfil the Luſts of the Fleſh, and of the Mind, and be fruitful in the works of Darkneſs, and God love me ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the worſe: no danger of forfeiting my Sonſhip, if this be true; all the Precepts of Vertue and Holineſs, with all the gracious Promiſes of an Eternal Reward in Heaven, are all in vain; and all thoſe powerful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions from Sin, with thoſe ſevere threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:35591:51"/> of an Eternal Puniſhment as a Reward to the guilty, are all invalid, if the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſinner, the moſt prophane Liver, may arrive at Heaven as well as the moſt eminent Saint: Did ever ſuch Doctrines proceed from the Lips of Truth, or are they to be found in the true Sayings of God? No, no, but rather the contrary, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 8, 9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10, 11. Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that no Man that is an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſinner, is, or can be ſaid actually to be Elected till Grace comes, and Faith comes and puts him into Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. This is evident from the <hi>Epheſians; Paul</hi> calls them <hi>Elect or Choſen before the Foundation of the World;</hi> and yet however Elected, he tells them, that during the time they walked according to the Courſe of this World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they were the Children of Wrath as well as others, and at that time <hi>they were without Chriſt, and Strangers to the Covenant of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, having no hope, and without God in the World,</hi> Eph. 2. 12. Surely it is impoſſible for any Perſon to be in Chriſt and out of him; dead and alive; old and new born at one and the ſame time; ſo that before Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we are not actually juſtified: This is ſo clear a thing, that the Aſſembly in their Confeſſion <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. ſay, <q rend="inline">God did from all Eternity decree to juſtifie the Elect.

                  <p>Yea, but we do not read of thoſe that perſevere in their ungodlineſs, that he will juſtifie them; for as God hath never promiſed, ſo he never purpoſed Salvation to an unregenerate heart, and a looſe life. Perſons may pleaſingly dream themſelves the Friends and adopted Children of God, tho' they will know, to their own ſmart, that all that are under the Reign of ſin, are yet under wrath: No Enemy to God and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is actually elected, nor hath receiv'd the Spirit of Adoption; and if they have not receiv'd the Spirit, they are none of his.

                  <p>Why, becauſe their believing and obeying the Goſpel, was an Effect of their Election: Our Perſons muſt firſt pleaſe God before our Actions can pleaſe him; and when once God loves a Perſon, he never ceaſeth to love him, <hi>for the Gift and Calling of God are without Repentance, Rom.</hi> 11, 29. and ſo <hi>Malachi</hi> 4. 6. <hi>I am the Lord, I change not:</hi> Now if <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were elected before they were born, and that then God ſet his Love upon them, and after during their Unbelief and Sin, ſhould be ſuppoſed not to love them; it would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue a ſtrange Inconſtancy and Mutability in God; and ſo according to this Notion of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, God muſt be ſuppoſed one while to hate a Perſon when wicked, and another while to love him when regenerate.</p>

                  <p>Indeed, if we muſt needs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that God had elected <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> as <hi>Paul,</hi> or as Men ſimply ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:35591:53"/> and not as Believers, or as their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt by Faith; then for God to love a Perſon to Day, and hate him to Morrow, would evidently ſhew a change in his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the change made in the Creature. And I muſt needs tell you I like this plain dealing the beſt; you are herein truer to your Principles, than many of your Brethren that hold this Point of perſonal Election. But for my part, I believe that God loveth and accepts more of Actions that are good, than of mere Perſons; and contrary to what you ſay, that ſuch and ſuch Actions do therefore pleaſe him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Perſon pleaſeth him; but rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Actions pleaſe him, therefore their Perſons pleaſe him: tho <hi>God hates all the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 5. 5. yet ſaid he to <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted?</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 5, 6. <hi>Before his Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had this Teſtimony, that he pleaſed God, but without Faith he could not:</hi> Read <hi>John</hi> 14. 23. and 15. 14. and 16. 27. Theſe are thoſe that he will love; yet may thoſe that were once beloved of God by reaſon of Sin, come to be the object of his hatred, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 9, 10. <hi>But they rebelled and vexed his Holy Spirit; therefore he was turned to be their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and fought againſt them;</hi> Now you that ſay, that where once God loves, he muſt never ceaſe to love; Pray you, what think you of the Angels that fell? Do you think
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:35591:54"/> God did not love them while they ſtood in that pure and holy State, in which they were created? and if he did, do you think that he loves them now in their Apoſtacy? So God is ſaid to love <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet at another time he is ſaid to hate <hi>Iſrael, Jer.</hi> 12. 7, 8. <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 8. yet is this taken off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 15. whereas they were ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, God loved them again. So that God may love at one time, and hate at another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt change in him, in reſpect of Love or Hatred, becauſe no Perſon of Man is ſuppoſed to be the Object of elective Love, but only as Righteous, nor any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Object of Reprobation, but only as Wicked; ſo that the Love of God being ſet upon ſuch kind of Perſons as are true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, thoſe who have Chriſt formed in them, whoſe Souls are regenerated and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Image of Jeſus, and Partakers of the heavenly and divine Nature, having received that heavenly and divine Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by virtue of which they become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>John</hi> 15. being wrought into a Conformity to Jeſus; this is that State, in which the true Election ſtands; Chriſt being the elected Root, and Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers the elected Branches. Theſe are thoſe whom God doth juſtify, and will glorify; theſe are thoſe whom the Lord hath ſet apart for himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 3. Theſe are thoſe whom the Lord hath choſen from the reſt of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:35591:54"/> the World to be his own peculiar Favourites, upon whom he intends to beſtow an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inheritance; and as Perſons decline from Chriſt, living in a State of Unbelief and Impenitency, being Strangers to the Life of God, diſobedient, and to every good Work reprobate, they remaining ſuch, are in that ſtate in which Reprobation ſtands, not being brought over to Chriſt, <hi>in whom the Father is well pleaſed.</hi> So that I conceive that Unchangeableneſs which the Scripture aſſerts of God, is to be conſidered with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Eſſence, Attributes and Decrees, and not in his conſtant loving the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, how wicked ſoever they prove. For, ſuppoſe God ſhould dearly love a Perſon while he is faithful to him; and in caſe this Perſon ſhould apoſtatize, and die in a ſtate of Impenitency, and he ſhould deſtroy him with eternal Death, this doth not ſhew the leaſt Alteration in any of the Lord's Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, either of Love, Goodneſs, Mercy, Juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſuppoſe a Man paſſeth from a State of Sin, wherein he lived to the Diſpleaſure of the Lord, to a State of Faith and Holineſs, and in this Condition comes to injoy the Love and Favour of God; yet his Love and Hatred cannot be ſaid to be changed, tho the Perſons of Men change never ſo often from Good to Evil, or from Evil to Good: This ſhews indeed a change in Man, but no change at all in the Lord;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:35591:55"/> he ſtill loves and hates, but what he loved and hated before. Pray conſider, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. <hi>at what Inſtant I ſpake,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>if it doth Evil, I will repent:</hi> Here you ſee God is ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, ſo he is ſaid to repent that he made Man upon the Earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 6. he is ſaid to repent that he made <hi>Saul</hi> King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 11. And yet the Scriptures cannot be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, which teſtify <hi>that with God is no Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or ſhadow of change,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 29. <hi>Num.</hi> 23. 19. <hi>James</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 25. yet here is no real Contradiction: And as I ſaid before, in reſpect of his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, Attributes and Decrees, God cannot repent; yet after the manner of Men he is ſaid to repent, in reſpect of his Works; for as Men, when they repent, alter their Works, ſo, when God alters his Work, he is ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>deſtroy Man from the Earth, for it repents me,</hi> &amp;c. God made Man to dwell upon the Face of the Earth, but now coming to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Man from off the Earth, ſeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; and ſo concerning <hi>Saul, I repent that I have made</hi> Saul <hi>King,</hi> that is, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to depoſe him, and to prefer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And ſo concerning <hi>Ely,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Delawn Sacr.</hi> p. 50. So that no ſuch Concluſion can reaſonably be drawn from God's once loving, he muſt for ever love (how wicked ſoever the Perſon proves afterwards) or elſe be mutable; for I do not find in Scripture,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:35591:55"/> that God hateth any of the Works of his Hands, as they are his Creatures, nor any thing but Sin and Sinners for the cauſe of Sin: and there is the ſame Conſideration, or the like Reaſon of his Election being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon Faith and obedient Perſons, or Perſons really brought over to Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>I perceive what you are driving at: You hold that Faith and Obedience in us to be the cauſe of God's Electing or Chuſing us to Life and Salvation: Doth not the Scripture prove that Election is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to foreſeen Faith, not becauſe Men do or will believe, but becauſe they ſhould believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2, 3, 4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>

                  <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
                  <p>This is down-right Popery; nay, I affirm, that Faith and Repentance are no more a means to go to Heaven by, than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Curſing and Swearing.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>That Faith in Chriſt, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Lord, is a cauſe without which God chuſeth none to Life and Salvation, is a Truth, unleſs you can prove that God hath deſigned his Son to die, to ſave ſuch as will neither repent of their Sins, believe, nor obey him, but live and die in open Rebellion againſt God, and do deſpight to the Spirit of Grace, and trample under foot the Blood of the Son of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that it is the cauſe for which God chuſeth any, I diſown as well as you: For the Love of God the Father to the Sons of Men, as they were Sinners, and Enemies to him, was the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial cauſe of our Salvation, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6, 8, 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. and Jeſus Chriſt the meritorious and procuring cauſe of Man's Salvation; and ſhould we admit of any thing elſe but Chriſt to be the matter of our Juſtification, or the meritorious Cauſe of Eternal Life, this would be injurious to the Perfection of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and overthrow the freeneſs of Divine Grace and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:35591:58"/> Love. But you and all Men ought rightly to divide and diſtinguiſh between the Cauſe and Condition of our Salvation, that Chriſt may be owned as the Cauſe and Author of it, and Faith and Obedience as the way and means to attain to it: for as God Almighty hath prepared a Heaven for Men, ſo he hath appointed the way and means to fit and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for it; as Chriſt is the Way, ſo if I ſhould ſay that Faith and Obedience is a way to come to enjoy it, I might ſay it was advancing Nature above Grace, or ſetting up our own Righteouſneſs in the room of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and ſo robbing him of his Honour, or aſſerting Merits; ſurely Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs hereafter hath ſome depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon Holineſs here.</p>

                  <speaker>Mod.</speaker>
                  <p>I like this well, and do believe that God that hath appointed the end, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo appointed the means, as in the Caſe of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 27. 22. though God had promiſed to ſave <hi>Paul</hi> and all that were in the Ship, yet they were to uſe the means, otherwiſe they could not be ſafe. I would have none think, that God will do all our Works for us, while we ſit ſtill and do nothing: For as God muſt blow upon the Spark of Grace by his Spirit, ſo we ſhould be ſtoring up Holy Endeavours; God will not bring his People to Heaven ſleeping, but praying in the uſe of Means and Holy Ordinances, yet may Means and Duties be greatly abuſed if we be not careful.</p>

                  <p>Yea, they are abuſed when we do not look through them all to Jeſus, or when we make them as Mediators, ſet them in the room of Chriſt; or when Chriſt is not eyed, ſought to, admired and truſted in: Alas! What can poor Sinners do without a Jeſus? There is no Salvation in any other; the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt meaſure of Believing, Doing, or Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cannot turn away God's Wrath for the leaſt Sin: All our Prayers, Tears, Alms, Duties, do not pacifie God; no, we muſt with Holy <hi>Paul</hi> count all as nothing to win Chriſt; ſo that had not Chriſt perfectly fulfilled the Law, and have been made a Curſe for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. the exacteſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian could have no grounded hopes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there is no eſcaping the Curſe but by Chriſt; ſo that all that do, or have eſcap'd the Curſe, have cauſe to ſay, that not their own Graces, nor their own Works, but Chriſt hath delivered them from Wrath to come. 'Tis Chriſt's precious undertaking that gives us a right to Heaven; but yet our walking in the Holy Commands of God, fits us for it, <hi>For without holineſs none ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12. 14.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35591:59"/> his Son to die for his People; and free Love in Chriſt to lay down his Life for the Elect: neither is it the Elect, but Chriſt that ſtands engaged to God by the <hi>New Covenant;</hi> free Grace wholly excludes Self, or any thing we can do, as a Cauſe procuring, or as a Condition qualifying us for the receiving of it.

                  <p>Tho' the Love, Grace and Mercy of God in our Redemption be wholly free; no one ſought out to him for a Saviour, but he alone was moved by his own Love to a poor loſt Creature, and firſt ſought after him, when he was fallen; God was not bound to bring forth a Saviour for any, he was not laid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any neceſſity to caſt an Eye of Pity upon Man; it was an Act of free Grace to ſave Sinners by the Obedience and Suffering of Jeſus: Yet is nothing to be accounted free Grace, without the Lord, for the ſake of Chriſt, pardon the Sins of the moſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and Impenitent, and bring them to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35591:59"/> Heaven whether they will or no? Was not God at liberty to pardon Sinners in what way, and upon what terms he pleaſed, ſuch as he in his Wiſdom, ſhould judg moſt meet, and moſt conſiſtent with his Juſtice, Mercy, Truth and Holineſs? God hath no where promiſed to ſave Men by Jeſus Chriſt, that I know of, but by Repentance, Faith and Obedience, as the means, as you may ſee, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16, 36. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 3, 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7, 8, 9, 10. and in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9.

No, but to ſuch as obey him; 'tis true, Chriſt came into the World, that the Sentence of Eternal Death might not be executed upon us, yet 'tis ungrateful wickedneſs, and no better than to tread under foot the infinite price of Forgiveneſs, to think, becauſe his Blood hath purchaſed a Pardon, therefore we are freed from our Duty to him. And whereas you ſay that in the <hi>New Covenant</hi> Man is tied to no Condition that he muſt perform, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that not Man but Chriſt ſtands engaged to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> methinks 'tis a very ſine way to acquit your ſelf of all Sins, and conſequently of all puniſhment for Sin; but if Chriſt ſtands ingaged to repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and obey the Goſpel, how comes it to paſs that Perſons are exhorted to them, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:35591:60"/> charged with Sin upon the omiſſion of them?

                  <p>I am ſatisfied that this Scripture is greatly abuſed for want of a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and rightly diſtinguiſhing between that Righteouſneſs which doth juſtiſie us at the Bar of God's Juſtice, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:35591:60"/> that Righteouſneſs which is God's Require<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo the Creatures Duty; now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in one Senſe, they are no better than filthy Rags, and in the other they are: now if we expect to merit Heaven, and obtain Eternal Salvation for well doing, this is to overthrow the bleſſed undertaking of Jeſus Chriſt, and leſſen the free Grace of God, as if Perſons could go to Heaven without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beholden to Jeſus. And here it is that they are no better in the ſight of God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no worth or value, but are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of the Lord as filthy Rags: but now as they are the Holy Commands and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments of the Lord, and the Creature's Duty; who dare ſay that they are in the ſight of God, as filthy Rags, or as ſtinking Carrion? What, hath God required his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to perform ſuch and ſuch Duties, and hath promiſed his Spirit to aſſiſt them in the performance of their Duties; and when the Creatures have done the beſt they can, nay when they have the aſſiſtance of the Spirit; What, all no better than Abomination? Ah! what pity is it that Men, to hold up a fond O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, ſhould have ſuch unworthy thoughts of God; What ſaid <hi>David Pſ.</hi> 141. 2. <hi>Let my Prayers be ſet forth before thee as Incenſe, and the lifting up of my hand as the evening Sacrifice;</hi> and ſaid the Angel to <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> 10. 4. <hi>Thy Prayers and thy Alms-deeds are come up for a memorial before God;</hi> they were acceptable
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:35591:61"/> in the ſight of God, and the Lord was well pleaſed with them, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 16. <hi>but to do good and to communicate, forget not; for with ſuch Sacrifices God is well pleaſed:</hi> and ſo <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>An odour of ſweet ſmell, a Sacrifice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and well pleaſing to God:</hi> Read <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 11. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 35. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 4.

                  <p>If of Works, then not of Grace; there's no Reward belongs to any good Works, Heaven and Eternal Salvation is the free Gift of God: And I muſt tell you, that all ſuch as you are ſtand condemned, and accurſed by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that ſet up the Golden Calf of your own Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>What, is it not poſſible for free Gift and Reward to ſtand together, nor for Goſpel-Dutys, and a heavenly Reward to be linked and joyned together; or is it a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to God, to ſay he rewards his own Grace? What, are you ſuch a Stranger to the Scripture, that you have not read of Recompence or Reward, which God will beſtow upon thoſe that are faithful, not for the deſert of the Work or Worker, but for the Faithfulneſs of the Promiſer, which God, who cannot lie, hath promiſed? Pray read <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>Bleſſed is he that hath Mercy upon the Poor, the Lord will recompence that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:35591:61"/> which he hath given him.</hi> And ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>a Cup of cold Water ſhall not loſe its Reward,</hi> Matt. 10. 24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 34. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. But it ſeems you would put it out of all doubt, that you pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon your own Righteouſneſs; and that the Almighty, by his Bounty and Grace, having elected you, he cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any Duty from you. You muſt (as <hi>Cliford,</hi> in the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> p. 197. ſaith) <q rend="inline">Have a cheap Religion, Faith without Works, pardon without trouble of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and Heaven without Holineſs, and free Grace to ſave you without Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or you are undone to Eternity.</q> Indeed, if any ſhall believe that their own Obedience to any Precept of the Lord, juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly merits Heaven, then they might dance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Duties, as the Iſraelites about their Golden Calf; but I hold no ſuch thing, but do believe that we are far from meriting any thing at the Hand of God; for he that merits muſt do theſe three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. He muſt do the Work of himſelf, without the Help and Aſſiſtance of another; for if he doth it by the Help and Aſſiſtance of another, the other merits both the Praiſe and Reward. Now, where is the Man that can come forth, and ſay, that what good he doth, he doth it without the aſſiſting Grace of God; and if he cannot ſay ſo, then the Thanks and Praiſe is due to God alone.</p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:35591:62"/>
                  <p n="2">2dly. He muſt do it of mere good Will, and not of Duty; that which is of Duty cannot merit, becauſe a Man is bound to do it; ſo that if Men could love the Lord with all their Hearts, Strength and Soul, and their Neighbours as themſelves (which is a thing no Man can do) yet is it far from meriting, becauſe it is but their Duty, and but a reaſonable Service, that they ſhould honour the Lord with that which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him, as holy <hi>David</hi> ſaid, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 11, 12. and ſo on: the more we do, the more we ſtand indebted to Divine Grace, for enabling us to do it; what have any, that have not received it firſt from God? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly. The Work done to merit, muſt be proportionable to the Reward, or there can be no Merit; but alas! what's the beſt of Performance, which is performed by infirm Man? can it have that Worth and Dignity in them, as to oblige the Lord to give unto them eternal Life, by way of Retribution? If God ſhould reward us according to our Works, miſerable would be our Caſe; ſo that unleſs it can be proved, that our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Work is comparable to the Glory which is to be revealed, there can be no Merit, 'tis a free Gift, 'tis Bounty: for ſuppoſe I ſhould ſet any Man to work, to mow in my Field; and for that Labour give him a Shilling, or Fourteen, or Sixteen
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:35591:62"/> Pence; here's only Equity and Juſtice the Man's Labour really deſerved it; but if for this one days faithful Labour, according to his Strength, I ſhou'd give him a Thouſand Pounds, this is Bounty: ſo that no finite Creature or Worker can merit an infinite Reward; or a finite Act cannot merit of an Infinite God an Infinite Reward.</p>

                  <p>Therefore, you that preach and preſs to Duty, are but legal Preachers and ſuch as would lead Men to Popery, and into a dead Faith; for it much derogates from the free Grace of God, and leſſens the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of Chriſt's Merits, and at beſt makes but moral Chriſtians.</p>

                  <p>Is there any ſuch thing as Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Duty to be obſerved? if there be, may they not be preached, and urged? or how can any of you that own the Scriptures ſcorn or diſallow it, ſeeing it calls the Saints not only to the Study and Practice of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but alſo to grow and increaſe in it, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 58. Tho we cannot merit Heaven, yet 'tis our Obedience, both in Heart and Life, makes us capable of injoying Heaven, through the Redemption of our Saviour: we muſt be Workers or Labourers, not Loyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the Chriſtians of his time to be working out their Salvation with
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:35591:63"/> fear and trembling: It ſeems the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are to do ſomething towards their own Salvation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 17.

But it ſeems we muſt not acknowledg God a Rewarder of his own Grace, or any good Duty which he enables his People to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, but ſtraight we preach Popery: how then can any deſire to be good, or do good?</p>

                  <p>For all the preſſing us to Duty, yet we do not build the Hopes of our Salvation upon ſo ſandy a Foundation as our own Righteouſneſs; our hopes are in the Lord, we put our truſt in Chriſt, and hope to be ſaved by his precious Undertakings.</p>

                  <p>I never did, nor I hope never ſhall deſire you to lay the ſtreſs of your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon your well doing, for that would be to build upon the Sands indeed, a very infirm Foundation: Seeing that without ſhedding of Blood, there is no Remiſſion of Sin, and conſequently no Heaven. Yet, give me leave to tell you, that to expect Salvation through Chriſt, without Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Heart and Life, is a moſt infirm Foundation to build our hopes of Heaven upon; and indeed 'tis nothing but down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:35591:63"/> Preſumption, and at the beſt but the hope of the Hypocrite which will periſh, <hi>Job</hi> 8. 13, 14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19. If you think to find Heaven, becauſe Chriſt died for your Sins, and you not bound to the actual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of thoſe Duties God hath injoined you to perform; I cannot ſee but you muſt ſhew us another Goſpel, yea, and blot out all the Ten Commandments: But I tell you, Chriſt himſelf will not ſave ſuch; 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Attributes of his Juſtice, for <hi>he will render to every one as their Works ſhall be,</hi> Rom. 8. 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9.

                  <p>If you can prove it from the Scripture, I'll hear you, but I ſee you do not that; and as for thoſe Divines you ſpeak of, tho they may be Men of Piety and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet we ought to follow no Man, but as he follows Chriſt, nor take notice of the Quality of Perſons, and what they believe, but the Solidity of their Proof, and how they agree with the Standard of God's Word: for want ofthis, Perſons are ready to ſuck in corrupt Notions, without any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Examination, merely becauſe others ſaid it, for whoſe Piety and Learning they have a great and venerable Eſteem; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when Mens Perſons are admired pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, their Notions, tho never ſo unſound, are received as the Oracles of God: which thing has been of fatal Conſequence in all Ages, and has given footing to moſt, or all the peſtilent Doctrines and Errorst hat have incumbred the Church of God. Pray ask thoſe Divines you ſpake of, whether they will ſtand to this. That the Law, as it is the Mind and Will of God, is a Creature; whether there is any thing in God periſhable or changeable. As Learned as they hold theſe three things as a Truth.</p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:35591:64"/>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. That God wills nothing in time.</p>

                  <p n="3">3dly. That God cannot have any Will which for the preſent he hath not.

Chriſtian Liberty is a freedom from Sin, not in Sin; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 18. it is a free ſerving of God, to do his Will, not the will of the Fleſh; we are called to

Goſpel Grace brings glorious freedom, 'tis true, from the Curſe of the Law, the guilt of Sin, and wrath of God, and from the burden of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Ceremonies, Sacrifices, Circumciſion, with other heavy Yoaks; yet is this Liberty to be confined to Scripture Rules. Believers freedom ſhould be like the Heavenly Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Angels are free, but 'tis to Duty, not Rebellion; and here will come in the ſureſt Mark, and the beſt Evidence of our Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 7, 10. <hi>Little Children, let no Man deceive you; he that doth righteouſneſs is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in this is manifeſt the children of God and the children of the Devil.</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 6. <hi>If we ſay we have fellowſhip with him and walk in darkneſs, we do but lye.</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 19.</p>

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:35591:67"/> the Suffering of Chriſt, doth not actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ours upon the bare ſhedding of his Blood, till it be receiv'd by Faith; for his Death doth not neceſſarily ſave any, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as God the Father, Son, and Spirit ſhall think fit to communicate and diſpenſe with the Iſſues of them; as he that pardons an Offender, may bring him to Terms before he pardons him; and he that diſpenſeth Crowns and Scepters to unworthy Perſons, may require Homage and Obſervance from them, without rendering it no Act of Grace. As to the Law, I ſay we are not juſtified by that, but by Chriſt alone receiv'd by Faith, and that it is neceſſary that Godly Preachers ſhould teach the Moral Law, or the Doctrine of Good Works, as the Doctrine of Faith; for Satan is a deadly Enemy to both.</p>

                  <p>I believe ſo too; but why ſhould
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:35591:67"/> you condemn honeſt Men fearing God, as on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Moral Men, and as ſuch who muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly go to Hell, yet others muſt eſcape it that are guilty of far worſe Vices, and who have been out-done by meer Heathens in their Practices? Some muſt queſtion their Condition for every Sin, though never ſo ſmall; but ſuch as you that reckon your ſelves true Believers, muſt by no means queſtion your Condition though your Sins be never ſo great: No wonder to hear ſuch expreſſions as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that if a Believer be overtaken with groſs Sins, yet he blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemes Chriſt that dare ſerve a Writ of Damnation upon him; and that if they be but Believers, and have once ſet their foot upon Chriſt, they need not ſtagger for the greatneſs of their Sins, nor their continuance in them; it ſeems tho you be not good Moral Men, yet you have a right to Heaven for all that.</p>

                  <p>Well, but there are many very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in the Myſtery of Faith; Faith hath the honour to be the Grace that apprehends the Mercy of God in Chriſt, and lays hold upon his perfect Righteouſneſs, by which Perſons come to be <hi>juſtified and to have peace with God,</hi> Rom. 5. 1. yea, by which Perſons become the Children of God, and by which they receive Chriſt as tendered to them in the Goſpel, and ſee him to be the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:35591:68"/> end of the Law. God hath now in reſpect to us, cancel'd the Law, which ſtood as a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing againſt us, and hath by the Goſpel ſhewed us a way whereby to be made Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous without the Law: nay juſtified from thoſe things, by which we could not be juſtified by the Law; for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>by the Works of the Law ſhall no Fleſh be juſtified, but by Faith,</hi> or by Chriſt made ours by Faith; this was the great overthrow of the Jewiſh Nation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. they being ignorant of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, went to eſtabliſh a Righteouſneſs of their own, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is a Righteouſneſs without the Law, and yet witneſſed to by the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: and the whole Law is fulfilled in the Children of God, becauſe Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is made theirs through believing; and I muſt tell you, that in many things Faith ſtands at defiance with Working and Doing.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>I believe, <hi>Moderatus,</hi> theſe things to be true, and that it is the work of Faith to do what you ſay; yet by the Scripture 'tis plainly evident, that 'tis not a bare na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Faith, a Faith that ſwims and floats in the Brain, or a lazy Reliance upon Chriſt, deſtroying of good Works, that can or will ſave any: let not any Perſons flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Miſery; for that Faith, that is barren of the Fruits of good Works, bears its own Curſe; that Faith that is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:35591:68"/> with good Works, is ſtiled a dead Faith, a Faith that can never bring us to Life, and no better than the Faith of Devils, <hi>James</hi> 2. 19, 20. And tho it is true, as you have ſaid, Faith hath the Honour to be the Grace that apprehends the Mercy of God in Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet this is not all that Faith doth, for it ſanctifies, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. and purifies the Heart, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9. 'tis a Fleſh-mortifying, and a World-conquering Faith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 4, 5. and leads forth the Soul to cleave to the Lord in obedience to his Will. Hence is it ſaid, that <hi>Enoch</hi> by Faith walked with God, and <hi>Abraham</hi> by Faith obeyed, and went, and by Faith offer'd his Son <hi>Iſaac:</hi> All Faith that is not ſuch a Faith is but a fancy, or a fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Faith, a Faith of the moſt wicked and profane, that believe they ſhall be ſaved, tho they never are ſanctified, and ſo over-look the Precept of our Lord, and Injunction of our Saviour. I may ſay in this caſe, as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in another; many, <hi>while they promiſe to themſelves Liberty, become the Servants of Sin;</hi> ſo many, while they advance the Grace of Faith, deſtroy the Power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not conſidering that they are two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable Companions: Perſons may as well ſeparate Light from the Sun, or Heat from the Fire, as true Faith and Holineſs; but for the preſent let this paſs. Have you any thing to ſay farther, to prove that God hath
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:35591:69"/> choſen ſome to Life, and rejected others without any reſpect to Faith or Holineſs?</p>

                  <p>I might prove it from <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel, Gen.</hi> 4. 4, 5. where you may ſee, that the Lord had reſpect to <hi>Abel</hi> and to his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and not to <hi>Cain</hi> and his Offering; and ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4. <hi>Abel</hi> offered a more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sacrifice than <hi>Cain.</hi> Now, it is not ſaid, that the Lord had reſpect to <hi>Abel</hi>'s Offering, but to <hi>Abel</hi> and his Offering; ſo that if you ask me, why the Lord had reſpect to <hi>Abel</hi>'s Offering, I muſt anſwer, becauſe he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>Abel</hi>'s Perſon: And why did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect <hi>Abel</hi>'s Perſon, but becauſe it was his pleaſure to chuſe him in Chriſt? For had not <hi>Abel</hi>'s Perſon pleaſed God, his Offering could not; and ſo the contrary of <hi>Cain:</hi> to <hi>Cain</hi> and his Offering he had no regard; <hi>Cain</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reprobated in his Perſon, his very Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was abominable in the ſight of God, and no leſs than Sin.</p>

                     <hi>Abel</hi> did offer a more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sacrifice, and God had a reſpect unto it for this Reaſon; becauſe <hi>Abel</hi> offered with a chearful Heart, and willing Mind in Faith: to which purpoſe 'tis ſaid, that he brought not only of his Sheep, but of the fatteſt and beſt of them; he did not think the beſt of his Flock too good to ſerve the Lord with; what he did, was from an upright Heart,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:35591:69"/> and for holy and divine Ends, and offer'd in Faith ſpiritually: But <hi>Cain</hi>'s Oblation was of the Fruits of the Ground, and (as it ſeemeth) without choice or difference, and from an impure Heart, and wicked Mind, or at the beſt done in Formality; ſo that the Lord accepting <hi>Abel</hi> was not the Effect of abſolute Election, but ſheweth the ſincerity of <hi>Abel</hi>'s heart, and the demonſtration of his great Faith; neither was <hi>Cain</hi>'s Rejection the real effect of an irreſpective Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but rather of his outward formality and inward corruption; for afterwards the Lord ſaid to <hi>Cain, If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted?</hi> God is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance, and <hi>Cain</hi> amongſt the reſt.</p>

                     <hi>Martha,</hi> Univerſal Redemption is no rotten or unſound Doctrine; for if it be, then Chriſt did not die for all, which is to give the Lie to the Holy Ghoſt, ſeeing the Scriptures in great plainneſs and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Words, aſſert the Redemption of all by Chriſt, without excepting ſo much as one: For to my knowledg, I never yet
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:35591:70"/> read in the Scripture, that Chriſt laid down his Life for ſome few elect Perſons only; neither do I believe any Scripture can be produced, that affirms that Chriſt died only for the Elect, only for Believers; or any Text that denieth that he died for all Men, without exception; if it doth, ſhew me the place.</p>

                  <p>No, not at all; tho Chriſt did lay down his Life for his Sheep (for ſuch as hear his Voice and follow him) and loved his Church, ſo as to give himſelf for it; yet it doth not ſay, that he loved no other, nor laid down his Life for none but his Sheep; ſeeing the Scripture ſaith, he bought thoſe that deny him: neither did Chriſt die for any, as they were his Sheep, as Saints, or as his Friends, but as his Enemies and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſuch as were polluted in their Blood, and without his gracious Undertaking for them were like to periſh.</p>

                  <p>Had Chriſt died for all, he would have prayed for all, <hi>John</hi> 17. 9.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:35591:71"/> he ſaith, that he prayed for them that were given him of the Father, that had, or ſhould receive his word believingly: and he ſaid he prayed not for the World; which World muſt be underſtood of thoſe that were not given him by the Father, the Non-Elect; he had no deſire they ſhould be ſaved.

                  <p>Could it be proved, that Chriſt did not pray for all, yet it doth not follow, that he did not die for all; becauſe no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, Chriſt did not die for thoſe he did not pray for, <hi>Scripture Redemption freed from Reſtraints,</hi> p. 75. And Dr. <hi>Homes,</hi> in many things a Friend of yours, yet upon <hi>John</hi> 3. 37. p. 15. ſays, When Men urge that Argument out of <hi>John</hi> 17. 9. Chriſt prayed
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:35591:71"/> not for the World, therefore he paid not for the World: The Conſequence may be excepted upon many good Reaſons; for tho Chriſt did not pray for the World, yet he might pay for the World.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. Paying is giving Satisfaction, praying ſolicites God's Mercy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. Paying containeth a Preparation of the Plaſter, neceſſary for Man's Salvation: Praying is the means of applying the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the Malady.</p>

                  <p>But ſurely, if Chriſt had prayed for the World, that the World might have ſavingly believed in him, and known him, then the World would have believed on him, and known him; becauſe, whatſoever Chriſt prayed for to the Father ſhall certainly be granted: Chriſt was always heard of the Father, and the Father's Mind and Will was eternally known to the Son, and he came into the World to do the Father's Will. Now, Chriſt knowing that there was a World, which the Father never intended to redeem, to give him to die for, it would have been vain, yea, inconſiſtent with the Wiſdom of Chriſt, to have prayed for that which ſtood diametrically oppoſite to the Will and Intention of the Father.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>Chriſt made Interceſſion for Tranſgreſſors, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 12. and prayed for his Enemies, for thoſe that crucified him, that they might be forgiven, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 34. and alſo commanded us to pray for our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, for thoſe that perſecute us, <hi>Matt.</hi>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:35591:72"/> 5. 44. and for the World Chriſt prayed for, as I have proved: but it ſeems by what you ſay, that Chriſt did not pray for the World with his whole Heart, or with a deſire to obtain what he prayed for. Now, whereas you ſay, that whatſoever Chriſt prayed for ſhall certainly be done, and that he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways heard, this I believe; it was, and ſhall be, according to what he intended: yet when Chriſt prayed that the Cup might paſs by him, tho he prayed very earneſtly, he was not heard, becauſe this Prayer was conditional, and with Submiſſion to his Father's Will: and ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. ſaith of Chriſt, who in the Days of his Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How was Chriſt heard in this? was he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from Suffering? no, his Prayer was conditional, if the Lord will; but he was ſo heard, as to get ſupport under his Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. But if whatſoever Chriſt prayed for, was abſolutely granted, without any Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to fit the Creature for Mercy; then thoſe Jews and Gentiles that crucified him, muſt be forgiven, without Faith or Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, becauſe Chriſt prayed that they might be forgiven. This would be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Wiſdom of Chriſt, to pray for that which ſtood diametrically oppoſite to the revealed Will of his Father: For where do you find the Lord hath promiſed,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:35591:73"/> that any ſhall be forgiven their Sins, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they repent or not? you your ſelves grant, notwithſtanding this Prayer of Chriſt, that the Wrath of God burned at the ſame inſtant of time, and afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome of the Accuſers, Condemners, Crucifiers and Mockers of Chriſt. <hi>Synod of Dort. Part</hi> 2. p. 82, 83. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> p. 565. Again, Chriſt prayed in this Chapter, that all thoſe that believe in him might be one (as he and his Father were one;) yet where do you find, that Chriſt was heard in this, that there was no Diſunion in Affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Saints, as there was none between him and his Father? And did not he pray the Father to keep his Diſciples from Evil? can you infer from thence, that they never ſinned, nor ſuffered? Whatſoever Chriſt prayed for, I believe God the Father did grant him an Anſwer to, according to the true intent of his Prayer.</p>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:35591:73"/> Chriſt, are <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. <hi>God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life:</hi> and ſo <hi>John</hi> 6. 51. <hi>He is the propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only, but the ſins of the whole World,</hi> 1 John 2. 2. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the World to himſelf.</hi> Here you ſee from theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with many more that might be added, that Univerſal Redemption is no rotten, nor no unſound Opinion; here Chriſt died for the whole Word.</p>

                  <p>Ay, for what World? for the World of Believers, the World of the Elect, that ſhall in the ſucceſſive Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World believe: 'tis not to be underſtood in ſuch a Comprehenſive Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, to include all the Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the World; for the World is taken two ways in Scripture; largely for all Men, and ſtrictly in a reſtrained Senſe for the Elect, or Believers: Taken in this Senſe Chriſt died for the whole World; by the World underſtanding the Elect, diſperſed up and down the World.</p>

                  <p>But where doth the Scripture ſpeak of a World of Elect Perſons, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Elect are oppoſed to the World; as, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 19. we know, <hi>&amp;c. John</hi> 14. 17. <hi>John</hi> 15. 19. but if by the World be meant
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:35591:74"/> the Elect only, then it will follow that God gave his Son to dye for thoſe that ſtood in no need of him; for God by Virtue of his Abſolute Prerogative might pardon Sinners without the Death of his Son. Now for you that hold there was an abſolute Election, and an abſolute Reprobation conſider'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Fall, and that without reſpect to Faith in Chriſt on the one hand, or diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience on the other, what do you do but overthrow the Truth and real Expiation of their Sins by the Death of Chriſt for them? For if God in his Elective Love, did in the very Act of Election, freely, and of his meer good Will and Pleaſure, irrevocably aſſign and give to his Elect Juſtification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then Chriſt could not die to purchaſe theſe things for them, becauſe they were theirs truly and of right before, and ſo he needed not die to bring thoſe into Covenant with God, and to make them near by his Blood, and to make them dear Children to God, who were all this before: for thoſe that were Elected unto Life, upon the account of their being abſolutely Elected to Salvation, they are likewiſe upon the ſame account in actual favour with God, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready beloved of him, with the higheſt Love, and ſuch as is peculiar to thoſe that are the Sons of God.</p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:35591:74"/>
                  <p>But again; if by the word <hi>World</hi> be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Elect only, then this word <hi>whoſoever</hi> muſt needs imply, that ſome of the Elect might poſſibly not believe, and ſo Chriſt muſt be ſuppoſed to ſpeak at no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a rate of Wiſdom and Senſe than thus, God ſo loved the world of Believers, that whoſoever of the world of Believers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him, ſhall not periſh. Nay, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if there be Salvation in Chriſt for none but the Elect (in your ſenſe) then it is not true, that <hi>whoſoever believes in him ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that it cannot be meant of the Elect only, read the two preceding Verſes, 14, 15. with this whole Verſe, and the words following: for as <hi>Moſes lifted up the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> &amp;c. and, Ver. 17. for <hi>God ſent not his Son into the World to condemn the World.</hi> If then we muſt underſtand the Elect here by the World, then we may read the words thus, God ſent not his Son into the World to condemn the Elect, but that the Elect ſhould be ſaved: this was to affirm that which none was likely to deny, or ever trouble themſelves or the World about.</p>
                  <p>But again; if by the World we muſt needs underſtand the Elect only, then will the Parallel between <hi>Moſes</hi>'s lifting up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, and Chriſt's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lifted up upon the Croſs, run very lame: for <hi>Moſes</hi> did not lift up the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:35591:75"/> with an intent that none ſhould look upon it, and receive healing by it, ſave a ſmall parcel; but that whoſoever was ſtung might look upon it, and that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever did look upon it ſhould receive heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 8. Now you will hold, that all without exception are ſtung with Sin, will you not?</p>

                  <p>Very well; then unleſs Chriſt be lifted up with an intent, that every Man might believe on him, and every one that ſhould believe on him, ſhould be ſaved by him, he could not be ſaid to be lifted up for the univerſal benefit of all thoſe that were ſtung with Sin, as <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, for the benefit of all that were ſtung with the fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Thus you may ſee that by <hi>the World,</hi> muſt needs be meant the whole Lump of Mankind; and thoſe that take it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, do greatly eclipſe the Mercy, Love, and Goodneſs of God to all his Creatures.

                  <p>Well, pray read out the whole Verſe, and you may ſee cauſe to believe, that by the World is there meant the Elect, becauſe, he ſays, <hi>not imputing their Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes:</hi> Now it is plain he doth impute the Sins of all Men to them but the Elect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but unto them he doth not impute Sin; therefore he reconciles unto himſelf none other but thoſe he doth not impute Sin to, which are the Elect.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the word <hi>World</hi> ſignifieth only ſome part of Men in the World, and not the intire Univerſality of Men, as <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 27. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 3.

                  <p>I know the word <hi>World</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies only ſome part of the World; but where do you find the Elect called <hi>the World,</hi> in oppoſition to thoſe that are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Strangers unto God? but it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put for the Wicked, who are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the World, as <hi>John</hi> 1. 10. and 7. 7. &amp; 14. 17. &amp; 15. 19. &amp; 16. 20. &amp; 17. 9, 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 32. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 1. &amp; 4. 5. &amp; 5. 4, 5. Hence the Devil is called <hi>the Prince of the World,</hi> John 12. 31. &amp; 14. 30. &amp; 16. 11. But that this 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant only of the Elect, may be proved from the word <hi>reconciling.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation ſignifieth, a making thoſe Friends that were before at variance. Now how can it be ſaid, <hi>That God was in Chriſt, reconciling to himſelf</hi> thoſe with whom he is not, nor ever was offended? Nay, he was ſo far from being offended with them, that he loved them with ſuch a Love, that he did abſolutely purpoſe (from the Fall, which was long before the coming of Chriſt in the Fleſh) to confer Eternal Life upon them.</p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:35591:76"/>
                  <p>Beſides, the Apoſtle is not there ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any inward Act of God upon the Souls of Perſons, whereby they are brought to believe in Chriſt, whereby they come to witneſs their Peace with God; <hi>Being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith, we have Peace with God:</hi> But he is there ſpeaking of the Tenor of the Goſpel, the word of Reconciliation which was committed unto him, and whereof he was a Miniſter, and tells them, <hi>That God was in Chriſt, reconciling the World to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> The Quarrel began in <hi>Adam,</hi> Sin was that which ſet God and Man at variance, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 1. But now the Lord being mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take whole <hi>Adam</hi> into Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and to found a Univerſal Covenant of Peace, was pleaſed to appear in Chriſt, that <hi>thoſe that were Strangers, and afar off, might be made near, yea the Sons of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I'll give you a Scripture that is far from ſuch Objections, 'tis 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 2. <hi>He is a Propitiation for our Sins; and not for ours only, but for the Sins of the whole World.</hi> Here you plainly ſee that Chriſt <hi>is a Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for the whole World,</hi> as oppoſed to Believers, therefore he muſt needs die for all. Now theſe words were ſpoken to ſtrengthen the Faith of thoſe that through the ſubtilty of Satan, and prevailing Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, were fallen, or ſhould fall into Sin, and thereby raiſe doubts in their Spirits, whether Chriſt died for them, or was a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:35591:77"/> Propitiation for their Sins, or not. Now the Apoſtle, to remove all doubts and fears out of their Minds, tells them, That he did not die for ſome few particular Men only (which might have augmented their fears) <hi>but was a Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World.</hi> Now this will greatly add to the Comfort, and put new Life into a ſorrowful tempted Soul, one caſt down under the ſenſe of Sin, to think that Jeſus Chriſt is a Propitiation for his Sins, being the <hi>Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World.</hi> But pray tell me, what could it add to the comfort of thoſe to whom <hi>John</hi> wrote his Epiſtle, who were weak in Faith, to tell them that Chriſt was a Propitiation for the Sins of all his Elect ones, for ſome few particular Men; but a great many, yea the far greateſt number, ſhall have no part with Chriſt, but ſhall be damned? Would not ſuch a Doctrine rather augment their Fears than their Comforts? Would they not be ready to ſay, Ah, then I fear I am none of thoſe that Chriſt is a Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for? Therefore the Apoſtle puts the matter out of all doubt, by telling them that Chriſt by his Death became a Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, or made a full Atonement for the Sins of all Men, without excepting ſo much as one Perſon in the whole World. But that Chriſt died for all, I prove from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Who gave himſelf a Ranſom for all, to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:35591:77"/> be teſtified in due time.</hi> If you look back to the Context of this Verſe, you will find <hi>Paul</hi> exhorting his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> That <hi>Prayer and Supplication,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhould be made for all Men;</hi> and telling him, That <hi>ſo to do, was good and acceptable in the ſight of God.</hi> And to prove that it is good and acceptable in the ſight of God to pray for all, he lays down this for his ground, <hi>That God would have all Men to be ſaved.</hi> And for a further confirmation, that it is the Will of God that all Men, without exception, ſhould be ſaved, he gives this reaſon for it; that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus gave himſelf a Ranſom for all:</hi> ſo that Chriſt's dying for all, gives us a ground for Faith to pray for all Men; which we could not do if Chriſt did not die for all, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14.</p>
                  <p>I would have you, <hi>Philetus,</hi> to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. a Text that you cannot well cavil with: the Apoſtle thus argues, <hi>If one died for all, then were all dead;</hi> but one died for all, therefore all were dead. The thing that the Apoſtle is about to prove, is, that all were dead; and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium to prove it is, that one died for all; ſo that if it be clear that all Men were dead by the fall of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> it muſt be clear that Life was offered to all by the death of the ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> for if Chriſt died for none but the Elect, then the Elect only were dead, for the word <hi>(all)</hi> muſt ſignify as
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:35591:78"/> many in the <hi>minor</hi> as it doth in the <hi>major,</hi> or elſe the Apoſtle's reaſoning would be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious.</p>
                  <p>And ſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 32. <hi>God hath concluded all in unbelief, that he might have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all.</hi> Now if this laſt <hi>(all)</hi> belongs to none but the Elect, then none but the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect were concluded in unbelief: but it is plain that all without exception were, firſt or laſt, concluded in unbelief; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Mercy was meant to all without exception.</p>

                  <p>But you know very well, that this word <hi>all men</hi> is not of neceſſity to be taken ſimply and univerſally for all without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any, but is very often taken in a reſtrained ſignification, when a part is put for the whole; as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>and all the Cattel of Egypt died;</hi> that is, all that were in the Field: and ſo, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 22. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 2. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Jeruſalem, and all Judea, and all the Regions,</hi> &amp;c. that is, very many Men of thoſe places: and ſo <hi>John</hi> 10. 8. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 5, 17. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 23. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 42. with many others.</p>

                  <p>Tho it be true, that the word <hi>all Men</hi> is not at all times to be taken for all Men ſimply or univerſally; yet it never ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the ſmalleſt number in compariſon with a greater: however, it cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here for ſome of all ſorts of Men, or for the Elect only, or the like, but of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:35591:78"/> neceſſity for all Men univerſally. If we take it in any other ſenſe, we make the Apoſtle to argue very weakly: for mind, here is firſt a Duty enjoyn'd, <hi>I will that prayers,</hi> &amp;c. and to ſtir us up to ſo good a work, he tells us, that <hi>'tis good and acceptable in the ſight of God,</hi> becauſe his Will is, that all ſhould be ſaved; God is ſo kind, ſo tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, that out of his love and pity, he would have all Men injoy a happy and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed end; and therefore in Charity we muſt pray for all, no Men, tho never ſo wicked and profane, are to be excluded from our Prayers, unleſs we know them to be ſuch as have committed that unpardonable Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 5. 16. Now if by <hi>all Men</hi> we muſt needs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſome of all ſorts of Men, or the Elect only, then the <hi>all</hi> we are to pray for, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and extendeth not ſo far as God extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Love. Again, if we muſt take it in your ſenſe, then we may read the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle thus; 'Tis good and acceptable in the ſight of God, that we ſhould pray for all Men, without exception of any, becauſe God would have all his Elect to be ſaved: ſurely the word <hi>all</hi> in both places is of the ſame extent. Much of the ſame nature is 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. wherein the gracious and good Will of God toward all Men appeareth, there it is ſaid, <hi>the Lord is not willing that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhould periſh;</hi> here the Apoſtle aſſerts an
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:35591:79"/> unwillingneſs in Chriſt, that any Perſon of Mankind whatſoever ſhould periſh; and therefore delayeth his promiſed coming, and exerciſes much patience and long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, his will and deſire being, that no Perſon whatſoever ſhould periſh, but that all might by his patience and long-ſufferance be led to Repentance: which if it be a Truth, then doubtleſs we muſt here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>all Men,</hi> and not reſtrain it to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect only: for the Lord is not here ſaid to be not willing that any of his Elect ſhould periſh, but that all theſe ſhould come to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; but not willing that any univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance <hi>(viz.)</hi> as they are Men, while they are capable of Repentance, that ſo they may be ſaved.</p>

                  <p>This Text alſo muſt be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Elect; therefore, ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>The Lord is long-ſuffering to us-wards, not willing that any of the Elect, or true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, ſhould periſh,</hi> &amp;c. and if you mind, this Epiſtle is writ to the Elect, to thoſe that had obtained like precious Faith with God's Elect.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>But the contrary will appear, if you conſider the Perſons here mentioned are thoſe towards whom the Lord exerciſed much patience and long-ſuffering: what, are they the Elect with whom the Lord is not angry? therefore no need of patience;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:35591:79"/> for there is no room for patience to take place, but only in ſuch caſes, where a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is apt to be ſtirred up and provoked; but now God was never offended with the Elect, but loveth them with the greateſt love that can be, neither (according to your Principles) were they in any danger or poſſibility of periſhing, therefore could not the patience and long-ſuffering of God have any reference to any ſuch End, either of Salvation, or Condemnation, they hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salvation infallibly aſſured to them by the irrevocable Decree of God. So that let Chriſt's coming be long or ſpeedy, or ſhould they die the firſt moment they breath in this World, or live after never ſo many Sins committed, yet their Salvation being decreed of God, and that Decree irreſiſtible, muſt needs produce their Salvation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if we ſhould underſtand it of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, then we may, without wrong to the Apoſtle, bring him in ſpeaking thus, God is patient to the Elect, not willing that any of his Elect ſhould periſh, but that all the Elect ſhould come to repentance: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt needs underſtand, that the patience and long-ſufferance of God is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed toward thoſe that contemn his Grace, yea, ſuch as go on in Sin, treaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Wrath to themſelves againſt the day of Wrath; yet the Lord exerciſeth his goodneſs and forbearance and long-ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:35591:80"/> that ſo his Goodneſs might lead them to repentance, <hi>Rom</hi> 2. 3, 4. yea, thoſe that the Apoſtle calls <hi>Veſſels of Wrath fitted for deſtruction,</hi> are yet endured with much long-ſuffering. There is nothing that makes the Lord withhold his hand of indignation againſt the Wicked, but the tender Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion that is in him through Chriſt: and therefore is the long-ſuffering of God ſaid to be <hi>Salvation;</hi> this is the main End and Deſign of God's Patience, and affording Sinners a Day of Grace, that ſo Grace and Mercy might be obtained; and his Goodneſs and Mercy leads them to repentance; and ſo long as God exerciſeth his long-ſuffering towards any, they are under a poſſibility of Repentance. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19, 20. We read that the patience and long-ſufferance of God waited upon Sinners in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> and all thoſe 120 Years he afforded them means of Repentance by <hi>Noah,</hi> who was a Preacher of Righteouſneſs to them: this ſhews that they were not under an abſolute Decree of Reprobation, but rather God would have none of them to periſh; if they do periſh, it is through their own fault and folly.</p>
                  <p>Now this is very conſiſtent with the Will of God, and the Mind of the Holy Ghoſt in other Scriptures; as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 30, 32. and 33. 11. we find this People was ready to affront and cavil with the moſt High,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:35591:80"/> much after that rude manner, as in <hi>Paul's</hi> time, in the 9th of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and as you and many others in theſe our days, who ſay, that <hi>Children are made liable to Eternal Death by their Parents Tranſgreſſion,</hi> before they had any Sin of their own; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding God hath ſaid, nay ſworn, the contrary. Is it not ſtrange to think how you complement, nay, diſſemble with God? when you pray unto him, you tell him how merciful and bountiful he is to all, and when you have turn'd your backs, repreſent him as a hard Maſter, making us pay for that which we never taſted, and puniſhing us for that fault which he knows others had committed, with ſuch like injurious Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and horrid Blaſphemies: ſo here, theſe fly in the Face of God, and charge the Death of the Wicked upon him, and boldly lay the blame at his Door, and ſay, <hi>The Ways of the Lord were not equal;</hi> tho when the Lord comes to judg every one according to their Work, the inequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity will be found on their ſide, not on God's: for, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 17. &amp; 25. 10. here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Lord proceeds to vindicate his moſt righteous proceedings with the Sons of Men, and ſhews, that <hi>the Son ſhould not bear the iniquity of the Father, nor the Father the Son's, but the Soul that ſins ſhould die;</hi> and therefore calls upon them to repent.</p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:35591:81"/>
                  <p>Where now is the Man that dares charge the God of Heaven with his Deſtruction?

I know and believe the Scripture ſtands full of Exhortations, and many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in his Revealed Will; but he hath a Secret Will contrary to his Revealed Will, relating to the ſame People and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: So God would have all Men to be ſaved, and none to periſh, by his Revealed Will; yet by his Secret Will he would
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:35591:81"/> have Millions to be damned: and tho it be his Revealed Will that all Men ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his Son, and all ſhould, as you ſay, repent and turn to God; yet his Secret Will is, they ſhall neither do the one nor the other.</p>

                  <p>I believe God hath a Secret Will and a Revealed Will, a Will that neither Men nor Angels know.</p>
                  <p>If it be God's abſolute Will that the greateſt part ſhould be damn'd, it is then the duty of the greateſt part of Men to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly to Hell and be damn'd: and to do good, would be a Vice; to labour to attain Heaven, a Sin, becauſe it croſſeth the ſecret Will of God: and if it be God's Revealed Will that all ſhould repent, and his Secret Will that very few ſhall, it follows from thence that it is his Will that his Will ſhould not be done; and that when a Reprobate ſaith, <hi>Thy Will be done,</hi> he rather curſeth himſelf than prays for a Bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>And ſince you affirm that God hath a Secret and a Revealed Will, I would have you careful that you do not interpret his Revealed Will by what you conjecture of his Secret One, his Secret Will being a thing that cannot be known; but rather gueſs at his Secret Will by his Revealed one, and ſo judg of his Eternal Decree by what we find in his Word concerning his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Threatnings, which are the Copies
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:35591:82"/> of his Decrees. It is very ill done of you to ſay, God hath a double Will, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will being not only diverſe but op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit to his Secret One, God ordaining Sin with the one, whilſt he forbids it with the other; and not always willing in ſecret what he reveals himſelf will do.</p>
                  <p>So that by what you ſay, you had as good tell us God doth not mean as he ſpeaks, and ſo make him a hypocritical Diſſembler. This is a very high Affront put upon the Divine Goodneſs, and your Teſtimony is not at all to be credited, unleſs you have the Witneſs of God for you, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. For whoſoever delivers any thing for a Divine Truth, if it be contrary to what is revealed to us in the Scriptures of Truth, it ought to be rejected as Diabolical Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions; all things of this nature muſt be warranted by the Word. Let our Hearts be never ſo ſtrongly inclined to believe it; yea, let Perſons pretend never ſo much to the Spirit, and to receive new Light, yet if it be contrary to the Spirit of God ſpeaking in the Scriptures, 'tis no better than a deluſion of the Devil; therefore <hi>to the Law, and to the Teſtimony,</hi> Iſa. 8. 20. John 16. 13, 14, 15. 1 John 4. 6. Now ſeeing by this your Speech you make the pure and holy God (who hateth and deteſteth, yea, forbids and puniſheth Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy and Diſſimulation in Man, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15.

                  <p>I cannot prove it in thoſe poſitive terms, but if you look 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. it may give us ſome grounds to think ſo; <hi>I ſaid indeed, that thy Houſe ſhould walk before me for ever; but far be it from me,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>I called for a proof, that God hath a Secret Will, and a Revealed Will, contradictory to each other, relating to one and the ſame Perſons and Things; and inſtead of that you bring two Texts that make nothing to the purpoſe; that of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:35591:83"/> 
                     <hi>Jonah</hi> concerning <hi>Niniveh</hi> ſheweth, that God's Will, whereof one part revealed and preached by <hi>Jonah</hi> was, that <hi>Niniveh</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed within 40 days if the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof repented not, but remained in an obdurate and impenitent State; and the other part of God's Will which was kept ſecret and concealed was this, that it ſhould not be deſtroyed if it did repent within that time; ſo that that part of God's Will that was revealed, and the other part kept ſecret and concealed, was one and the ſame, and tho delivered in poſitive words, yet there was a Condition implied in them, tho not expreſſed. That <hi>Niniveh</hi> was not deſtroyed at that ſet time which the Lord threatned they ſhould, plainly ſhews that his Purpoſes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings were conditional: Upon ſuppoſition of their Impenitence he threatned to deſtroy them; but when they repented, he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to preſerve them: this you know by what <hi>Jonah</hi> did when he withdrew to ſee what God would do with the City, and by what the King and People did; they underſtood the whole Will of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, tho but part thereof was vocally revealed: therefore I heartily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you, to deteſt that vile School-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, of a Secret and Revealed Will in God oppoſite one to the other; ſo that by his Revealed Will he would have none to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:35591:83"/> periſh, but profeſſes his unfeigned deſire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Salvation of thoſe that periſh, and ſeems to be burdened in himſelf, and lament over thoſe that ſtubbornly run in deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive courſes, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 29. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 13, 14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48. 7. &amp; 65. 2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 4, 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 37. and yet by his Secret Will he hath no deſire after their Salvation: Nay, he's ſo far from willing or deſiring their Salvation, that he hath grounded and ſettled Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to deſtroy them for ever. By his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will he would have all Men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe in his Son, and by his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Will, the contrary: Now if there be any Secret Will in God whereby he willeth the deſtruction of any, at the ſame time that he willeth the Salvation of all, theſe two Wills muſt needs contradict one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and of two contrarys, if one be good, the other is bad; and ſo in God's Secret and Revealed Will, if one be good, the other is bad.</p>
                  <p>But ſurely, if God injoyns Repentance, Faith, and Obedience unto all Men, with Promiſes upon their complying with his Will they ſhall be ſaved, as <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19. <hi>John</hi> 20. 21. then he doth not will with a Secret Will, the condemnation of any: for 'tis clear that his Revealed Will runs, that he would have all men every where to repent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and certainly his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will muſt needs be one with his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:35591:84"/> Will, or elſe we ſhall repreſent the great God of Truth as falſe as Man: for if God's Word, which is his Revealed Will, be no Interpretation of his mind and meaning, then it is not true; for that ſpeech that is no ſignification of the Mind is a lie: <hi>God's love to Mankind,</hi> page 96. this is properly lying (ſaith <hi>Lombardus</hi> as quoted by <hi>Morton,</hi> Page 51) when a Man ſpeaks any thing contrary to his mind. And ſaith <hi>Aquinas,</hi> this is properly to lie, when a Man ſignifies in outward words, another thing than that which he thinketh in his mind. And whereas you charged Univerſal Redemption as ſavouring of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, pray what greater piece of Popery than their mental Reſervation, and wicked Equivocation, ſaying one thing, and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another? Have there not been whole Volumes writ to detect it? But if profeſſing one thing while the contrary is intended, be Holy in God; why not in them? or if ſome things in God may be Holy which are abominable in Man, by what Rule muſt we diſtinguiſh between Holy things in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are Holy alſo when found in Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſuch other Holy things in God, which when found in Men are abominable? Is it not of dreadful conſequence to impute that to God, which common and approved Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon judges to be unrighteous in Men? His Works are ſo juſt, his Word ſo pure, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:35591:84"/> ſo merciful is he in his Ways, that there is no appearance to the contrary; and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his Covenant and Promiſes, he is moſt highly faithful and conſtant, and is in no wiſe a Diſſembler, that under ſuch moſt affectionate Expreſſions of Love and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Man, ſhould conceal ſettled Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Intentions of doing them the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Miſchief: Surely in God's Revealed Will cannot poſſibly lurk any mental Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation or Inſincerity.</p>
                  <p>What a diſhonour and a crime of a high Nature would it be, if Perſons ſhould deal thus with an earthly King, as you do with the King of Heaven? Suppoſe a King ſhould ſet forth a Proclamation of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pardon to all his Subjects that had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him, without excepting High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or any other Offence whatſoever; yet if they will but repent, ſubmit to his Mercy, ſue forth their Pardon, they ſhall have it: And now after all this is proclaimed throughout the Nation, others ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to proclaim that which is quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that tho it was the King's Pleaſure to offer ſuch a General Pardon, yet it was the King's Secret Will (yea, before the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation came forth) that the greateſt number ſhould never reap any benefit by it. Can any Man, indued with reaſon and underſtanding, any ways think that ſuch Officers proclaimed that which made for
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:35591:85"/> the King's Honour? Or if it was a Truth, would not the Soul of a Perſon abominate ſuch pretending to Kindneſs and Mercy? And now whereas the King of Kings, the God of Heaven hath vouchſafed an Act of Grace, and in tender compaſſion and pure love to all, hath ſent forth a General Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don tendering his Grace to all, telling us, that for his Son's ſake he will freely and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardon all our Sins whatſoever, if we will but accept of it; and if we ſue forth our Pardon, we ſhall have it freely; and the God of Heaven, to make this known to the World, has ſent forth his Meſſengers to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim theſe glad-tidings to all without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting one (Glory to God high on Earth, Peace, Good-will towards all) which was proclaimed by a Heavenly Herald. And how hath the Lord, both in the Old and New Teſtament, proclaimed and profeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a God, merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in Goodneſs and Truth: yea, how earneſtly doth he allure Perſons to repentance, promiſing them pardon of Sins with all the Bleſſings of the World to come, and ſeriouſly and ſolemnly proteſts and ſwears, that he deſires not their Death, he would not have one Soul of them periſh. But now if after all this others ſhould come and ſay, that tho it be the Revealed Will and Pleaſure of God, that ſuch a General Pardon ſhould be
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:35591:85"/> divulged to the World, yet it was the Secret Will of God, yea before this Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation came forth, it was decreed, that he would caſt out of his favour and devote to Eternal Burning, millions of his moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Creatures, Men, Women, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that never offended him, any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than Children may offend before they are born: Do you think ſuch words any ways advance the Glory, Holineſs, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of God? No; thus under per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of glorifying of him, you moſt diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him; as if God did not really intend that Grace and Good to Man which in his Word he tenders to them; and ſo Perſons muſt be damned, becauſe God did not really and in good earneſt call them, which is a thing more fit to be applied to Cheaters and Juglers, than to the righteous, pure, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and ſecret Will of God. Is it not pity you ſhould impute that to the Lord, which is proper to none but the worſt of his Creatures? ſurely all God's Decrees are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly juſt, and whatſoever he wills is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good, neither can he will any thing but what in it ſelf is Righteous, Juſt, and Equal; and to ſay of things unequal in themſelves, yet done by God, that they are juſt, is a great diſhonour to him. <hi>Wither</hi>'s <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe on the Lord's Prayer.</hi> How dare you ſpeak of ſuch a Will to be in God which he hath no where revealed in his Word? His

If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome things in Providence, or ſome Paſſages appear in Scripture that we cannot exactly reconcile, but that they ſeemingly oppoſe this Point, we ought to impute that to our deficiency in underſtanding, and to try if they may not reaſonably bear ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe, or reſerve them to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood hereafter, than to adhere to them in contradiction to the general Tenour of Scripture, and the Light of Nature and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſeeing nothing can be alledged which with that ſame clearneſs oppugns the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Goodneſs in God, as others may which aſſert it. And ſeeing the Nature of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:35591:87"/> Goodneſs conſiſts in the taking a pleaſure in the Happineſs of others, and in promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: We muſt conclude from hence, that God hates no Man, but loves and deſires the Happineſs of all Men; and that for his Will-ſake he reprobates none either from Eternity or in Time: to think otherwiſe, greatly oppoſes God in all his Attributes, it oppoſes his Mercy. God is in Scripture declared to be <hi>a merciful God,</hi> Exod. 34. 6. 1 John 4. 16. <hi>God is Love;</hi> yea called <hi>the Father of Mercy,</hi> and <hi>God of all Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> yea, <hi>rich in Mercy,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 4. <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in Mercy:</hi> Pray ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 5. <hi>He loveth Righteouſneſs, and Judgment; the World is full of the Goodneſs of the Lord:</hi> And <hi>Mica.</hi> 7. 18. <hi>He retains not his Anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in Mercy.</hi> And, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 9. the <hi>tender Mercies</hi> of God <hi>are over all his Works.</hi> But how God could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Mercy, and how his tender Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are over all his Works, I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. What, doth God delight in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, when he hath made ſuch a Decree, which ſheweth more Severity towards poor Man than Mercy? Are his tender Mercies over all his Works, when for one only Sin, and that once committed, and that not in their own Perſons, he hath ſhut the greateſt part of Mankind up under invincible Sin and Damnation? not affording them a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which was the greateſt and moſt

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:35591:89"/> of God's ireful Severity; yet is God more merciful to them than to ſuch Men: and though they are both ſure to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; yet in three things Man is in a far worſe condition by ſuch a Decree.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In their appointment to Hell, not for their own perſonal Sins, for which only the Devils are damned; but for the Sin of another that lived and ſinned long before they were born.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In their unavoidable deſtination to endleſs Miſery, under a colour of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: the Devils, as they are decreed to Damnation, ſo they know it and look for no other: But Men that are appointed to Wrath, are yet fed up with hopes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and made to believe, that if they periſh, 'tis not becauſe God would not have Mercy upon them, but becauſe they will not be ſaved, when indeed there is no ſuch matter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In their Obligation to believe, and the aggravation of their Miſery by not believing: The Devils, becauſe they muſt be damned, are not commanded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, nor is their puniſhment heightned by their not believing; but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Men, who by this Decree have no more liberty to eſcape Hell than the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, muſt yet be tied to believe in Chriſt, and have their Torments increaſed, if they believe not: May we not ſay, Where was the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:35591:89"/> ſounding of the Lord's Bowels, and his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? Were they not reſtrained? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 15.</p>
                  <p>Now tho I grant you, that God's Mercy is his own, and he might give it to whom he pleaſe, I do alſo grant, that when Man had ſinned, God was not obliged, but was abſolutely free and at perfect liberty whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would ſhew Mercy to any or not: The Love of God in Chriſt was undeſerved, undeſired, and every way free indeed; neither had it been unmerciful if God had made no proviſion for fallen Man.</p>
                  <p>But now ſeeing he was pleaſed to enter into a Covenant of Peace with Man, tho under no conſtraint or Obligation, and to give his Son a Ranſom, not for a few, but all, as a means whereby his poor Creatures might be ſaved, and hath promiſed Mercy, without exception, ſhould be vouchſafed to all that believe in his Son, and hath bound it with an Oath, that <hi>he deſireth not the death of a Sinner,</hi> that no cruelty is in him; but that he is a God gracious and merciful, thereby to beget in us ſuch ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thoughts of himſelf as might incline us to love him with all our heart and ſtrength; and without the leaſt ſcruple reſign up our ſelves to his Will:</p>
                  <p>Now, I ſay, ſince God, who was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely free, hath made ſuch Promiſes of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to all that believe in his Son, this his Promiſe binds him to perform it; he cannot
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:35591:90"/> deny himſelf, he's not like unto frail Man; he will not eat his own words; ſo that now he is not at liberty to deny Mercy to thoſe to whom he in his Word hath promiſed to ſhew Mercy, neither can he do it: for we may modeſtly affirm, there are ſome things God cannot do; God cannot lie, he cannot deny himſelf, neither can he deal unfaithfully and unjuſtly in his Promiſes, nor go contrary to his Will revealed in his Word: ſo till you prove by the Word of God, that he hath made no proviſion for the Salvation of all Men by the death of Chriſt, all you ſay proves nothing; neither do you yet ſhew me where the great Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of God's Mercy takes place upon thoſe for whom Chriſt did not die.</p>

                  <p>Doth not the Mercy of God won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully appear in this, that when Man had ſinned, and thereby run himſelf ſo far in debt, beyond any poſſibility to pay, but was liable to have been eternally a Priſoner, without any redemption from thence, till he had paid the utmoſt Farthing, neither Men nor Angels being able to make God amends for the wrong Man had done him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 7, 8. And whereas God being the moſt Soveraign Lord, and no ways a Debter to any of his Creatures, being not conſtrained by any inward Neceſſity, or outward Force, to ſhew mercy to any, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly at his own choice whether he
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:35591:90"/> would ſhew Mercy to any, having cauſe enough to caſt off Man for his diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as he did the fallen Angels; doth it not argue and prove more abundantly the rich Grace and Goodneſs of God, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for the Salvation of a few, than in making no proviſion for any, but leaving them to periſh in their Sins?</p>

                  <p>'Tis true, 'tis an act of Grace and Mercy for God to make proviſion for the Salvation of any by Chriſt, and to caſt his Love upon any of the degenerate Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> when he paſſed by the Apoſtate Angels, being inveſted with a power to ſhew Mercy to whom he pleaſe: But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if to ſhew Mercy to a few amongſt the many millions of millions of poor periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Creatures, renders God gracious and merciful, how prevailing muſt that Love be which hath made ſuch rich and full provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the Salvation of all Men, who unleſs they wilfully neglect ſo great Salvation, ſhall moſt certainly be ſaved? for if the providing for the Salvation of a few out of many, renders him moſt gracious and lovely, then if he had refuſed to make proviſion for any, certainly the greater the number for whom this proviſion was made is, the more lovely and gracious doth God appear. Pray take heed you do not bring your Soul under guilt, by denying Chriſt's Death for all, which is the greateſt illuſtration of his
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:35591:91"/> Love and Mercy to Sinners: for in my underſtanding, 'tis a great injury done to the Goodneſs and Mercy of God to affirm, that he hath eternally decreed the reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all mankind except a very few in compariſon of the reſt.</p>

                  <p>None can be damned but thoſe whoſe damnation God wills to glorify his Juſtice; for God wills the Salvation of all that are ſaved, and he wills the Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all that are damned: and tho it is certain that the Lord is gracious and full of compaſſion, and of great mercy, yet he hath <hi>mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth,</hi> Rom. 9. 18. It's true, there is ſuch infinite Mercy in God, that he could have pardoned all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that ſinned, and could have ſaved all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity: if he had pleaſed, there might have been no Hell, no place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Devils or Men; if he had pleaſed, there might have been no place but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for all the Angels, and all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men to ſing <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> to Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but we muſt not order what God ſhall do, how he ſhall exert and put forth his Mercy; but let his Grace and Mercy be adored for ever, in that he ſaves any that have ſinned, and his holy Juſtice ador'd in puniſhing ſo many with Eternal Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Sin. And God hath his Glory, not only from them that are ſaved, but alſo
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:35591:91"/> from them that periſh; in the one the Glory of his Grace, in the other the Glory of his Juſtice.</p>

                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>No, I do not think ſo; I believe that Juſtice and Mercy were eſſentially in God before all time, and both beloved and favoured by him; and to maintain the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and love God bore to Juſtice, he hath cauſed whole Nations to drink of the Cup of his Wrath: in this he threw the ſinful down from Heaven; drowned the old World; rained Fire and Brimſtone out of Heaven upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> &amp;c. yea ſuch love doth God bear to Juſtice, that not only Men and Angels, Citys and Nations, but Heaven and Earth and all ſhall fall, rather than God will not obſerve Rectitude and Juſtice, in giving to every one his due; yea ſo juſt is God, that he would not ſpare his beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son; yea, and God is glorified by Juſtice as well as by Mercy; and ſhould there be any jarring and diſagreeing in the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:35591:92"/> Divine Being, all would run into confuſion, yea, Heaven and Earth would be a Chaos: but certainly there is nothing more lovely, than when Juſtice and Mercy do imbrace and kiſs each other; God hath promiſed in Judgment to remember Mercy, and that he doth not willingly afflict and grieve the Children of Men; the Divine Goodneſs is ſuch, that he always pities where he muſt puniſh, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 33. and is very unwilling to ſtrike but from mere neceſſity; he ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never makes any Patterns of his Wrath, but ſuch as are deſpiſers of his Mercy, and forgetters of his Favours, yea, and after a long time of forbearance, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 2. So tho God hath a reſpect to Juſtice as well as Mercy, and one is as much beloved as the other, yet in the expreſſions of his Love to the Sons of Men, 'tis ſaid to be above all his Works: But where hath Mercy any place upon thoſe that are made the butts of God's Diſpleaſure? yea, view but the Scriptures, wherein the Mercy and Goodneſs of God are legible to all, and you will find that his love to ſinful Man is truly inconſiſtent with the Nature of thoſe abſolute Decrees you ſpeak of: ſee <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 8. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up, O Ephraim?</hi> &amp;c. Here the Lord ſpeaks as if to puniſh a ſinful and diſobedient People went to his very heart; yea, he is ſo unwilling to inflict Puniſhment, that his very Bowels are moved
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:35591:92"/> as is intimated, by turning within him. Conſider the caſe of <hi>Sodom,</hi> when upon <hi>Abraham's</hi> earneſt expoſtulation with the Almighty, the Divine Bounty roſe ſo high, that had there been in thoſe Five great Cities, but Ten righteous (the effectual Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of a righteous Man carry ſuch a kind of Omnipotency a long with them, that they tie, as 'twere, God's hands from Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and open them to Mercy; <hi>Let me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, ſaid God to</hi> Moſes) nay, it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, that not only Ten, but Five, or leſs, might have prevailed for the ſaving thoſe Citys.

Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this Scripture doth highly ſpeak forth God and Chriſt's great Love to Mankind, Sorrow mixt with Love and Pity: and you ſhall find few or none commenting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this text, but ſay, Chriſt ſhewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Love to theſe poor <hi>Jeruſale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites.</hi> Mr. <hi>Keach</hi> in his <hi>Scripture Tropes,</hi> having ſhewed the compaſſion of Chriſt to Sinners under the ſimilitude of a Hen, ſaith, <q rend="inline">that Jeſus Chriſt was moved with the greateſt compaſſion imaginable to wards the poor Jews, and <hi>Jeruſalemites,</hi> whom he was firſt ſent to, and came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeek and ſave; this is ſignified by that wonderful paſſion that ſeized upon his Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And having ſhewed with what a mournful Voice the Hen calls her

                     <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 42. And from thence doth infer it to be no better than preſumption, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to dare to charge their eternal ruin upon God.

                  <p>But here's a diſtinction which you either do not underſtand, or have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, as touching our Lord Jeſus; for he hath a Will diſtinct from his Will as God: Now as Jeſus Chriſt was Man, he wept; and as he was Man, he willed <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Salvation; but as he was God, he wills it not, for it was his determinate Will that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed as an effect of their Sins: therefore tho Chriſt did weep for <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> nay, had he prayed
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:35591:93"/> for them, God's unchangeable Will muſt take place; <hi>Tho</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Samuel <hi>ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 1.</p>

                  <p>I grant, tho as I ſaid before, that faithful Prayer greatly prevails with God; yet in ſome caſes the moſt importunate Prayer of the moſt upright will not become effectual; where Inquity is grown up to that height of malignity, and deſperate ſinfulneſs, that ſhould not God puniſh it he would deny himſelf, and ceaſe to be God, as he ſaith in <hi>Ezek</hi> 14. 14. that <hi>tho theſe three Men,</hi> Noah, Daniel, <hi>and</hi> Job, ſtand before me, and would intercede, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for others will become fruitleſs, where Juſtice calls for a cutting off: but your diſtinction about a twofold Will in Chriſt, I look upon to be but barely notional; and nothing but to gratify Peoples pregnant fancies (to ſay no worſe) and I doubt ſuch ſancies may prove of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; for by this, Chriſt in the Fleſh had one End in his weeping, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to gather <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in his Spirit another: Chriſt, as he was Man, would have ſaved <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but as he was God, he wills their deſtruction: Chriſt, as he was Man, was filled with bowels of pity to their Souls and Bodys, and would have gathered them under the Wings of his Grace, and would have bleſſed them, by <hi>turning them every one from their Iniquities,</hi>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:35591:94"/> Acts 3. <hi>ult.</hi> but as he was God, he had no more love for them than for Wolves and Tygers: Chriſt, as he was Man, wept for the Bodys of thoſe that ſhould be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Romans;</hi> but as he was God, he had decreed the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould deſtroy their Bodys, and the Devil ſhould have their Souls to Hell: Chriſt in the Fleſh is good and gracious, ſeeking the Salvation of all; but as God he hath conſigned mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Men, Women, and Children, to perpetual Torments for <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſingle tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</p>
                  <p>What, is Chriſt divided? is not Chriſt in the Fleſh and in the Spirit, <hi>the ſame ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, to day, and for ever?</hi> Was not the Word made Fleſh, and was it not united to the Divine Nature, and anointed with the Holy Spirit above meaſure; and did not he ſatisfy and bear our Sins, as he was Man, in our Nature? did not he die as Man, and riſe in our Nature; and hath he not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried our Nature into Heaven? And from this full Chriſt, in Fleſh and Spirit, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, we receive Grace for Grace. Leave off ſuch things, and draw not People into a Labyrinth of Errors by ſuch trifling Diſtinctions, leſt you draw ſome to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Blood of the Covenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are ſanctified, an unholy thing, and make all the Precepts of the Goſpel uncertain whether they be the Will of God
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:35591:94"/> or not; or whether Chriſt when he prayed to his Father for his People, or for Sinners, prayed as a Mediator, or as Man only; yea, give footing to that Opinion, which begins to evidence it ſelf too much in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, even denying the perſonal Union of God and Man in Jeſus Chriſt, in whom <hi>the fulneſs of the Godhead dwells bodily,</hi> Col. 2. 9. which did influence and give a value and worth to all things done for us by the Manhood; and therefore his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and his Blood was called, <hi>the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Blood of God,</hi> Acts 20. 28. 1 John 3. 16. Rom. 10. 3. Chriſt as he was God-Man, and our Mediator, what he did upon this account, in the Fleſh, he did in the Spirit alſo. Now in this place where Chriſt bewailed <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s ſtate with tears, either they flowed from true inward compaſſion, or they did not; if the firſt, then Chriſt in the Fleſh and in the Spirit, willed one and the ſame thing, and had no diſtinct Will for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Salvation as Man, different from his Will as God; but if the ſecond, then his tears were only feigned, and his bewailing nothing but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, which is a capital Sin to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm. And tho the Lord was reſolved to bring <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to deſolation, by deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into the hands of their Enemies; yet as you ſay, and ſay truly, it was an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of their Sins, the neglect of the Day
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:35591:95"/> of their Viſitation, mocking his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and ſtoning them that were ſent to her to have drawn her from the evil of her ways, and for crucifying the Lord of Life, thereby filling up the meaſure of her Iniquity. So tho the Lord brought her to deſolation, yet Puniſhment is rather his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge than his choice; and his defence againſt Sin, than the hurt of his Creatures; and the Sinner with his own hands moſt cruelly pulleth down puniſhment upon his own head: for the evil of Sin, and the evil of Suffering are Twins; or rather Sin gives birth and being to the other: God never inflicted the leaſt puniſhment on any mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Men, but as workers of Evil, as continuing ſinful and diſobedient. So that it was <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s actual Sins, and her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to be healed that brought her to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and not any irreſiſtible Decree of the Almighty; for you may as well deny the Being of a God, as entertain a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that he takes pleaſure in the death and deſtruction of his Creatures. His Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is perfect Goodneſs, and he is a ſtranger to Cruelty; and all the expreſſions of Love and Good-will in Chriſt to poor Sinners are ſuch, that they neither admit nor are conſiſtent with fraud or falſhood: ſo that yet you have not told me where the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of God merely takes place upon thoſe that God is reſolved, againſt all means poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

                  <p>But God's great Love to all Men, in giving his Son to die for them, is the ground and cauſe of their Love to God again: True love muſt firſt ſpring from the knowledg of God's Love to them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I think that any Men in the World will ever heartily and cordially love God, unleſs they believe that God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had deſigns of Love to them; yea, ſo far loved them, as to ſend his Son to die for them: otherwiſe inſtead of loving and living to God, it would tend to a moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and deſperate alienation of the Hearts of poor Creatures from their dear and ever-bleſſed Creator. For how is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the poor Creature ſhould deveſt himſelf of thoſe Delights and Pleaſures of this Life, and intirely love and delight
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:35591:96"/> himſelf in God and his bleſſed Will, if he knew, or had ſtrong grounds of fear, that before he made him, or without reſpect to his Sins, or unworthy carriage in the leaſt, he ſo far hated him, as to reſolve, againſt all Mediation whatſoever, to caſt him out of his ſight, and to doom him to ſuffer the Vengeance of Eternal Fire?</p>

                  <p>Who is able to perſwade Men by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or move them by Threatnings, to love God, whoſe love to them in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular is doubtful? Do you think it can, or ever will be a motive for Perſons to love God, to tell them, That before all Worlds, or before they were born, or there were any poſſibility of offending him in any manner, it was decreed, that the greateſt number of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Off-ſpring ſhould be
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:35591:97"/> eternally reprobated and damned? And tho he had provided means whereby Man might have been ſaved; and that the worth and value was ſo great, that it was ſufficient for the Redemption of thouſands of Worlds; yet then it was decreed, that very few ſhould have any benefit thereby, when they had done their utmoſt they could do to obtain it? Is it poſſible that Men ſhould truly love God, while they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him as an Enemy bent in an unappeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner to deſtroy them, and that to Eternity? can any thus be induced to love him, or live to him? Thus your Doctrine cuts aſunder the very Sinews of Religion, diſcourageth Holineſs, and encourageth Profaneneſs; for by your Opinion Heaven ſhall unavoidably be obtained by thoſe that are elected, and Hell muſt be as certainly endured by thoſe that are reprobated; and a Man may as well ſtop the Sun in its courſe, and mete out the Heaven with a Span, as force the Lord to revoke his Decree. Truly if poor Man lies under ſuch a rigid Fate, all that he can do for the obtaining Heaven, or avoiding Hell, is but a piece of induſtrious Folly. Why ſhould we take upon us a ſtrict courſe of Life? why ſhould we ſubmit to Divine Precepts, or addreſs our ſelves to God by Prayer; and like good <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſtle with him for a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing? to what purpoſe ſhould we maintain
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:35591:97"/> a warfare againſt Satan, Sin, and all Vice, when the greateſt induſtry, in the uſe of means to obtain them, ſignifies nothing, if not decreed to it? May not this cauſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be ſwelled up with ſorrow, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the chiefeſt inducements to Holineſs, when they ſhall ſeriouſly reflect upon all they had done to be purely in vain? And again, if Perſons be abſolutely appointed (by the immutable and irreverſible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Almighty) to deſtruction, 'tis not all their hearing, reading, praying, Works of Charity, nor all mourning for Sin, nor believing neither, that can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly procure their Salvation, damned they muſt be: And on the other ſide, if Perſons be abſolutely ordained to Salvation, their open contempt and neglect of all Holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, their living in pleaſure, and walking in ungodly courſes, cannot bring Damnation upon them, they muſt be ſaved.

In <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. 24. <hi>Judah</hi> when he heard that <hi>Thamar</hi> was brought in for an Adultereſs, preſently ſentenced her to the fire; but when the Pledges of his own Folly were brought forth, then he cried out, <hi>ſhe is more righteous than I.</hi> Conſider the proud <hi>Phariſee,</hi> tho he was ready to cry to the <hi>Publican, Stand off, I am more holy than thou;</hi> yet the other was more juſtified.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:35591:102"/> he took upon him the Nature of Man, not of Angels; he pitied not the Angels that fell, becauſe their Nature was not to be received by Chriſt, but he taking upon him the common Nature of Mankind, made it ſaveable, brought it nearer to Salvation than the lapſed Angels: and what Chriſt hath done in the Fleſh, he muſt needs have done for all, and the direct and immediate Fruit thereof belongs to all, for he took upon him our Fleſh, not the Fleſh of the Elect, but of Mankind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption being by his Blood wrought for us thro his Fleſh (in which all Mankind have union) it muſt needs be therefore univerſal.</p>

                  <p>Surely Chriſt took upon him the Nature of Men, becauſe the Elect Seed was found in that Nature, not in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Angels: the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15. that becauſe the Children were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Fleſh and Blood, therefore he took part of the ſame, and herein there is a Union; the Children have a Union with the Fleſh of Chriſt above all others in the World, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 30, 31.

                  <p>So do I: but did Chriſt die for all in ſuch a manner, and yet never intend their Salvation thereby? this juſtly ſeems ſtrange.</p>

                  <p>Why, 'tis one thing to die for the Reprobate in ſome ſenſe, and to die for them with an intention to ſave them.</p>

                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>As to the firſt I ſuppoſe you mean, that God is ſo bountiful a God, that he will not let the leaſt act of Charity, or the leaſt appearance of Good in any go unrewarded in this Life: And that Chriſt died for the obtaining of theſe leſſer Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but yet had no love for them in order to their Salvation, I have already diſproved.</p>
                  <p>But as to your ſecond, you ſay that Chriſt died ſo far for all, that there is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:35591:104"/> Argument from thence to perſwade all Men to live to him; but then I muſt prove, beyond all Exceptions, that God Almighty hath deſigns of Love to all Men, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after their Eternal Well-being, ſeeing that true Love to God muſt firſt ſpring from the certain knowledg of God's Love to us: And the Holy Ghoſt teacheth us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 19. that love to God muſt or ought to be kindled in the Hearts of Men, by the ſenſe of this Affection in God to Man: neither (as I ſaid before) can I think that any Man can heartily and cordially love God, unleſs he believes God had a love for him: And how can any uſe Arguments to perſwade all, or any Man, to love and live to God, whoſe love to them is doubtful? Neither doth any Man ſtand bound, either to uſe Arguments, or believe them when uſed, unleſs he hath a ſufficient reaſon to do ſo, ſeeing the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith, is Sin;</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a Man doth, not having ſufficient reaſon on which to ground his belief of the lawfulneſs thereof, is ſinful, and an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Act, and diſpleaſing to God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 2. &amp; 14. 15. All Arguments are out of doors, neither will wiſe Men uſe them to Perſons who are neceſſitated, by an over-ruling Power, to be what they are, ſeeing you will not ſay that Chriſt died with an intent they might be ſaved.</p>

                  <p>I believe Chriſt's Death was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for all: that is to ſay, the Death of Chriſt, ſimply and in it ſelf conſidered, was ſufficient to redeem and ſave all Men, yea many Worlds, as well as thoſe who are redeemed and ſaved by it; and ſo there is ſufficient ground to perſwade all Men to love and live to him.</p>

                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis true, the Satisfaction that Chriſt gave to Divine Juſtice, was infinite, his Righteouſneſs infinite, and therefore ſufficient for the Redemption of this and many Worlds had they been made. In this ſenſe it is ſufficient to ſave the Apoſtate Angels that fell; but have the fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels any ſufficient ground or reaſon to hope for Salvation, upon the abſolute worth and merit of Chriſt's Satisfaction?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philet.</speaker>
                  <p>No; Chriſt never died to free them from their Chains of Darkneſs, and to readmit them into the Love and Favour of God; and as <hi>Moderatus</hi> told us, he took not upon him the Nature of Angels, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no ground of hopes for them, God never by Chriſt provided for the Salvation of the fallen Angels, this was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Lord's Intention.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, you grant that Chriſt died ſufficiently for all, yet unleſs you grant that he died intentionally for all (that is, Chriſt by his Death hath purchaſed ſuch Grace and Favour in the ſight of God for all
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:35591:105"/> Men, that upon their repentance and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in him, they ſhould be juſtified, and receive forgiveneſs of their Sins, and perſevering therein, ſhall be eternally ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) the ſufficiency of his Death is no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground for any Man to believe in him, or to caſt himſelf upon him for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, no more than the fallen Angels.</p>
                  <p>Now either Chriſt ſhed his Blood for all, with an intent to ſave them (unleſs they be their own deſtroyers) or to damn them, or for nothing; pray tell me which of theſe three things Chriſt intended in dying for all?</p>

                  <p>Why truly, I believe, all that Chriſt did for the Reprobate, was to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect for them the good things of this Life.</p>

                  <p>For no uſe in reſpect of Eternal Life; all that it effects for them, is to make their Condemnation in Hell the greater; or, as ſome ſay, if they uſe it well, the lighter.</p>

                  <p>Others beſide the Elect may have the inlightning and conviction of the Spirit, and God hath wiſe and holy Ends in it, to reſtrain ſome of them from being Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:35591:105"/> of his Church, and to reſtrain them from groſs Idolatry, and ſuch-like Sins, whereby they are leſs puniſhed in Hell; but if they abuſe theſe common Graces, it will make their condemnation in Hell the greater.</p>

                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>Then was Chriſt's Death rather grievous than gracious; and Chriſt came not that they might have life more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, but that they might have Hell and Damnation more abundantly. Bluſh, O ye Heavens, at this! How cruel do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the God of Love? For if Chriſt ſhed his Blood for all, and yet did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Salvation to all, then he muſt needs ſhed his Blood not for them, but againſt them; and ſo God gave his Son to die for the condemnation of the World, contrary to our Saviour's Expreſſions, <hi>John</hi> 3. 17. &amp; 12. 47. &amp; 1. 29. So that here can be no potent Argument uſed to perſwade all Men to love and live to him; for he that ſhall pay for the eaſe and benefit of another, what was ſufficient to have eaſed me as well as him, and yet ſhall neglect me in ſuch a Paiment, and leave me in miſery, when he might, without the leaſt trouble or charge to himſelf above what he volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily put himſelf upon for the ſake of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, have relieved me, and of miſerable made me happy; what reaſon is there that I ſhould wholly live to him, who wholly
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:35591:106"/> neglected me in my greateſt need, or that he ſhould expect ſervice or thanks for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing? 'Tis a ſenſleſs conceit to think Men are engaged in any Bond of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs or ſervice unto Chriſt, for dying ſufficiently for them, unleſs he died inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally alſo.</p>

                  <p>What, do you believe Chriſt ſhed his Blood intentionally to ſave all? then if all be not ſaved, Chriſt muſt miſs of his Intention, God ſhall be fruſtrated of his Deſign, and Jeſus Chriſt be defeated of that excellent Honour provided by his Father for him: Now if one of thoſe that Chriſt died with an intent to ſave ſhould miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, why not another, and conſequently all, and ſo by this God's Counſel and Chriſt's Honour muſt be laid in the Duſt?</p>

                  <p>It may very well be conceived, that God may intend the Salvation of all Men by Jeſus Chriſt, and yet not all Men
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:35591:106"/> ſaved; nay, ſhould all Men prove ſo neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective of themſelves, as voluntarily to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themſelves of that great Salvation which Chriſt out of his great Love hath provided for them, yet it doth not follow from hence, that the Counſel or Deſign of God ſhould thereby miſcarry, nor Chriſt's Honour be laid in the duſt, becauſe of the wilful folly of Men to forſake their own Mercy, and deſtroy themſelves; ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 5. <hi>And now, ſaith the Lord that formed me from the Womb,</hi> &amp;c. Tho Chriſt was ſent to ſave, and make <hi>Iſrael</hi> bleſſed; and as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. ult. <hi>Hath raiſed up Jeſus, and hath ſent him to bleſs you, and to turn every one of you from your evil ways</hi> (here you ſee it was God's Mind to gather <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to turn them from their Sins) yet all <hi>Iſrael</hi> was not gathered, nor turned from their Sins; yet no diſparagement to Chriſt, nor a defeating the Counſel of God.</p>
                  <p>Indeed if it had been the Deſign and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of God, that the ſaving Benefits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Sinners by the Obedience and Sufferings of Chriſt, ſhould immediately become theirs upon the bare ſhedding of his Blood, and that therefore God muſt needs pardon the Sinner, and bring him in by head and ſhoulders, that is, by a ſtrong and irreſiſtible hand, ſave him whether he will or no, or whether they repent of their Sins, believe in him, or continue in impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:35591:107"/> then indeed if any ſhould miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, here would be a defeating of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and Intention of God: but ſeeing that as the Grace and Mercy of God in Chriſt to Sinners is abſolutely free; ſo is the Lord free to apply the Merits of his Son's Blood to whom, and in what way, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what terms he in his Wiſdom thinks fit: for we muſt not conceive that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſave Man upon any terms, or without any proviſion or exception at all, but to put the World into a capacity of Salvation, by removing thoſe grand Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which ſtood in the way of Mercy, and obſtructed its communication to the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to afford unto the Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Men means and opportunities to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe, and conſequently to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: ſo that whenſoever Chriſt is faithfully and effectually preached to Men, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit convinces Men of Sin in order to their Salvation, God obtains his end and intent concerning their Salvation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they come to be ſaved or no; ſo Chriſt is ſaid, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 2. to be <hi>the Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World;</hi> it doth not therefore follow, that the Sins of the whole World are ſo actually and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly atoned by him, that they ſhall never be charged againſt them; but that which Chriſt offered in order to atoning the Sins of the whole World, is ſo full of Virtue,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:35591:107"/> and withal is ſo propounded and held forth by the Lord unto the whole World, that if any Man's Sins remain actually unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, 'tis through their voluntary neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of this Sacrifice, not from any inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on God's part, that their Sins ſhould not be atoned as well as others.—Many more ſuch Teſtimonies I might add.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Holmes</hi> upon <hi>John</hi> 6. 37. pag. 13. ſaith, <q rend="inline">That all the Sins of Mankind are become venial in reſpect of the Price paid by Chriſt unto the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But all do not obtain actual remiſſion of Sins, becauſe moſt Offenders do not take out nor plead their Pardon as they ought to do. And, <hi>pag.</hi> 15. That the Lamb of God offering up himſelf (clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with humane Nature) a Sacrifice for the Sins of the whole World, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by giving ſatisfaction ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God's Juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to prepare a Sovereign Medicine for the Sins of the whole World, which ſhould be denied to none that were minded to take the Benefit thereof; howſoever he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, by applying this Alſufficient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to every one in particular, to make it effectual unto the Salvation of all, or to procure thereby at the hands of his Father actual Pardon for the Sins of the whole World: he applys this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly effectually to them, who make claim
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:35591:108"/> to the Satisfaction by promiſe, ſuing for the Spirit, and Faith, upon other Promiſes, in Prayer waiting for a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious anſwer till they have it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So in reſpect of his Merit he may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a kind of univerſal Cauſe of reſtoring our Nature, as <hi>Adam</hi> was of the depraving of it.</q> Much of the ſame nature, and almoſt word for word, is that of Biſhop <hi>

We need not refer the deplorable miſery of the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> to the Divine Will, as Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> is pleaſed to do, <hi>Inſtit. lib.</hi> 18. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. but the horrid perverſneſs of our own Wills: for the higheſt Act of Divine Intention is to ſave Men, if they do not by the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their own perverſe Will fruſtrate the ſame, by refuſing the gracious Offers of Salvation by Chriſt, and not obſerving the real Conditions upon which the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of Mercy are made; for the Lord doth ſolemnly prove that he is not willing that any ſhould periſh, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot lay the blame upon God in any thing, but wholly upon Man, who doth voluntarily bring Death and Miſery upon himſelf. Nay, <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf upon <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. ſaith, <q rend="inline">That Faith in Chriſt is of a ſaving Nature to all, and that Chriſt brought Life, becauſe his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

                  <p>But, <hi>Philadelphus,</hi> pray conſider (with reſpect to Chriſt's dying for all) that when our Saviour died as a Mediator, it was near 2000 Years from the Creation, and there were multitudes then in the Priſon of Hell, from whence there is no redemption; and do you think that Chriſt died upon the Croſs, and bore ſuch unutterable Dolours for them, to redeem them that were there? There was need indeed that Chriſt ſhould die for thoſe Saints that were in Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died, becauſe they were ſaved upon the account of his having undertaken as a Surety for them to make Satisfaction to the Juſtice of God for their Sins; but ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it will ſound very harſhly in the Ears of all Chriſtians, that Chriſt ſhould ſweat drops of Blood, and bear the Curſe of the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:35591:109"/> Law for them who were then in Hell when he died, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18, 19, 20.</p>

                  <p>The 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18, 19, 20. is of doubtful interpretation; and by your own grant, the doubtful ought to be expounded and tried by the Light and Teſtimony of ſuch as are more clear and evident. Now in this Text the Apoſtle ſheweth the great patience of God toward that wicked Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and that he ſtrove with them by his Spirit, and gave unto them a Preacher of Righteouſneſs, and a hundred years ſpace to repent in; and doubtleſs the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of God towards them was for this end, to allure and draw them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>But it ſeems you would not have any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Chriſt died for any of thoſe that before his coming in the Fleſh had withſtood the Day of Grace, and ſinned beyond the reach of Mercy: But there was need for him to die for thoſe that were in Heaven before he died, becauſe they were ſaved upon the account of his dying for them. Now I might ſhew you from your own ſenſe of Election being from Eternity, without any conſideration of Faith in Chriſt, how you abrogate the Grace of God in Chriſt, and make his Death to be in vain, ſeeing that God loved them every whit as well, and intended to do as much for them before Chriſt died for them, or
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:35591:109"/> before their ingrafting into Chriſt by Faith, yea, before the Blood of the Covenant was ſprinkled upon them, as after; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was no reaſon that Chriſt ſhould ſhed his Blood to procure thoſe things for the Elect, which were truly and properly theirs before, in and by God's purpoſe in electing of them, yea, and that without any conſideration of Chriſt's dying for them, or their believing in him.</p>

                  <p>Nay hold, we do not ſay that God intends actually to confer Remiſſion of Sins or Eternal Life upon the Elect, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than through the Satisfaction made by Chriſt for them in his Death; and tho God might intend and purpoſe Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Elect, without the conſideration of the Death of Chriſt, yet in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this his purpoſe, the Death of Chriſt is all in all; and you ought to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between God's Decrees and the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them.</p>

                  <p>If it was conſiſtent with the Wiſdom and Juſtice of God to decree for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of Sins and Salvation unto Men, without conſideration of the Death of Chriſt, or their believing in him, he may as well confer theſe things upon them without any ſuch conſideration; and then to what purpoſe ſhould Chriſt die?</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Philetus,</hi> were thoſe that were in Heaven before Chriſt's coming ſaved,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:35591:110"/> without Faith in him that was to come?</p>

                  <speaker>Philet.</speaker>
                  <p>No; all that were ſaved before Chriſt's coming, were ſaved by believing and imbracing him that was to come, and to be a Sacrifice for their Sins; in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of which they offered Sacrifices, and through which they looked at Jeſus who was to come.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>Then it is ſufficient to tell you that the want of that Faith in the Chriſt to come, and obedience to his Will, was the cauſe of their deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, conſider, Chriſt was <hi>the Lamb ſlain</hi> (virtually in the Decree or Purpoſe of God) <hi>from the Foundation of the World;</hi> and it was on the account of Chriſt's taking hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature upon him, that Man was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the World from returning to the Duſt from whence he was taken: for all Men live, and move, and have a being here, by virtue of the Lord Jeſus, the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and Believers did before Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Fleſh, partake of the real Virtue of his Death as if he had been already ſlain. So alſo Chriſt came <hi>into the World, not to condemn the World, but that the World through him might be ſaved,</hi> John 3. 17. and came to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt, to ſhed his Blood, to bear unutterable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, not only for them that were ſaved, but for thoſe alſo who through their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and impenitency were not ſaved;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:35591:110"/> their unbelieving and rejecting of Goſpel-Grace rendred them obnoxious to juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: for ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>the Goſpel was preached to them that were dead,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 6. tho they had not the Letter of the Goſpel preached to them (as with us at this day) yet they had the ſpiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Effect of the Goſpel preached to them; and therefore 'tis ſaid, that Chriſt went by his Spirit and preached to them, and their unbelief and rejection was a Sin againſt the Covenant of Grace: for thoſe before Chriſt, and thoſe ſince Chriſt came, are for the main under one and the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, yea eſſentially and for ſubſtance the ſame, the ſame Chriſt exhibited thro Types and Shadows, which we have revealed in the Goſpel with open face; and the ſame ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Duties, as Repentance, Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with the ſame ſpiritual Bleſſings, as pardon of Sin, Juſtification and Eternal Life. So that all Perſons being under one Covenant of Grace made with all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in the Promiſed Seed; and this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant the ſame for Subſtance both before and ſince Chriſt's coming; and all Perſons that were ſaved before Chriſt, being ſaved by a Covenant of Grace, and through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on him that was to come, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follows that the want of Faith and Obedience to the Lord Jeſus, according to their meaſure of knowing him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:35591:111"/> on him, was the cauſe of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. compared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 18, 19. So that I cannot ſee how it ſhould ſound more harſhly in the Ears of all Chriſtians, that Chriſt ſhould ſweat drops of Blood, and bear the Curſe of the Law for thoſe that were in Hell (if you will have it ſo) when he died, than that he ſhould ſweat drops of Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for thoſe that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his coming in the Fleſh ſhall go to Hell, notwithſtanding all that Chriſt hath done for them: ſo that Chriſt did really intend the Good and Benefit of thoſe that periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through unbelief, before his coming in the Fleſh, as well as after; if not ſo, I know not how any could uſe potent Arguments to perſwade them to love and live to him.</p>

                  <p>Come <hi>Philadelphus,</hi> the thing to be proved is this; whether Chriſt died equally for all and every Man? this I ſuppoſe you will not eaſily grant, for if Chriſt died equally for every Man, they would have equally the means of Salvation granted to them.</p>

                  <p>This is but a lame proof that Chriſt died not for all Men equally, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if difference of Means vouchſafed to Men, ſhould argue different Intentions in God touching their Salvation. You may as well prove by this Rule that Chriſt died not equally for the Elect themſelves, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they do not equally alike injoy the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:35591:111"/> Means of Grace: nay by this a Man, but meanly read in the Scriptures, may prove, that God bore more good-will to many that periſh, than towards many of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; for many periſh under more excellent and greater means of Salvation, than are vouchſafed to many that are ſaved, <hi>ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his hands all the day long to a diſobedient People, Iſa.</hi> 65. 2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 28. &amp; 11. 20, 21. &amp; 8. 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20. And in <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 3. our Saviour by that Parable holds forth to us theſe two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Death of Chriſt ſignified by the Oxen and Fatlings ſlain, was provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King for thoſe that never came to partake of the Feaſt, but were rejected becauſe they made light of the Invitation, and went away, one to his Farm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet Jeſus Chriſt, with the Bleſſing accruing thereby to Mankind, was equally intended for thoſe that periſh through their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, as well as for thoſe that are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; for they did neglect ſo great a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and when there was a prize put in their Hands, they had no heart to uſe it, <hi>Pro.</hi> 17. 16. yet notwithſtanding the neglect on their part, God was not wanting one his pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> to provide good things for them. The</p>
                  <p n="2">2d Thing obſervable is this, the King's Servants took more pains with thoſe that never came to partake of the Supper, than
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:35591:112"/> with thoſe that came; for thoſe that rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Invitation, were again and again called, whenas the other came at the firſt.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philet.</speaker>
                  <p>but if the Feaſt had been provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all, and God had called them in good earneſt, they would have come, or been compelled to it, as thoſe were that taſted of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>If the King had intended that thoſe who were invited ſhould never have taſted of his Supper, queſtionleſs he would never have invited them; for it's but mockage to uſe Arguments to perſwade Perſons to accept of a Feaſt, that was only and wholly provided for another, with as intent to exclude thoſe that were invited. Thus do you make the God of Truth a meer Deluder of poor miſerable Mankind, to cauſe his Miniſters to proclaim throughout the World the glad tidings of Grace and Salvation prepared for all Fleſh, and by the Goſpel open the Boſom of his Love to all poor Sinners, and by ſweet, loving, and gracious words, offer to them forgiveneſs of Sins, Life and Salvation, and yet never intend to beſtow it upon them: what is this but to repreſent God as hollow-hearted?</p>
                  <p>But it is clear that in the miniſtry of the Word, God doth as well perſwade the obſtinate, and many of thoſe that never believe, as he doth thoſe that do; as it is
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:35591:112"/> ſaid, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 15, 16. <hi>That the Lord God of their Fathers ſent to them by his Meſſengers, riſing up betimes, and ſending, becauſe he had compaſſion on his People,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But they mocked the Meſſengers, deſpiſed his Word, and miſuſed his Prophets, till the Wrath of the Lord roſe up againſt them.</hi> And thus doth the Lord in this Goſpel-day, being every way as ſerious in his preſſing the Goſpel upon thoſe that remain obdurate to the laſt, as upon thoſe that in time come to believe; as <hi>Paul</hi> preached the ſame Goſpel (at <hi>Athens</hi>) to thoſe that mocked, as to thoſe that clave to him and believed, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 32, 34. ſo that difference of Means doth not argue different Intention in God touching their Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Yet it is not denied but that God doth in his providential Diſpenſations, put a difference between one man's ſpiritual Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities and another's; all do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy equal Conveniencies and Opportunities, nor have Miniſters the ſame efficacy and power for converſion and edification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor are Men equally free from, or ſubject to temptations and occaſions of Sin, with many ſuch. I do not ſay Chriſt died for all, ſo that all ſhould injoy all theſe equally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; but that God did really, truly, and cordially intend the Salvation of one Man as well as another, conſidered as Men, in and by Chriſt's Death. What tho there be
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:35591:113"/> great diſparity of Means, and of Grace alſo (according to the Divine Will) yet ſufficient Grace is afforded to all, both to thoſe that do not actually believe, nor are really converted, as well as thoſe that are, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. <hi>Pro.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 37. <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 12. for whomſoever God calleth to Faith and Salvation, he doth it ſincerely and with unfeigned Intentions of ſaving them; <hi>John</hi> 5. 34. and 10. 20. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. and 6. 1. From all I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that Chriſt in dying for Man intended nothing but that which was real and ſaving in the proper nature and tendency of it.</p>
                  <p>But as to your third, <hi>Moderatus,</hi> you ſay Chriſt died for all Men ſo far that the Goſpel might be preached unto all: Now if you mean that in the Goſpel terms of Reconciliation are offered to all poor Sinners, and that the Word preached is by the Lord appointed an inſtrumental means to make Men new Creatures, and that the Lord by ſending the Goſpel, and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters upon the Goſpel errand, doth not thereby intend the Obduration and Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any, but the Converſion and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all; if this be your meaning, I and you are no more two but one; and I will ſay in the words of <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Lot, Let there be no ſtrife between thee and me, for we are bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> But if with <hi>Calvin</hi> in his <hi>Inſtitut.

                  <p>Do not we look upon the Goſpel the greateſt Bleſſing, next to Chriſt, that we can injoy or receive? But if the choiceſt Bleſſings are intended as Snares to intrap our Souls, we have little cauſe to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God for them. Theſe Scriptures ſpeak not of the primary and direct Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God in ſending Chriſt into the World, but of the Event, and that which many times is effected by it through Mens voluntary Rebellion: Chriſt was not ſent into the World with any intent on God's part, nor came with any intention of his own, to make thoſe that ſee to become blind, but with an intent to heal the blindneſs of all to their Peace and Glory; ſo that if any be blind, ignorant, and fooliſh, 'tis mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accidental: and tho the glorious Light of the Goſpel ſhould equally ſhine on all Men, as the natural Sun doth diffuſe his Beams to all Places, yet it hath not an equal effect on all alike; for the ſame Beams that cauſe the Flowers to ſmell, make the Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hils ſtink; yet this is but accidentally, as it finds matter to work on, no fault being in
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:35591:114"/> the Sun: ſo in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. we read of ſeveral effects the Word hath, not from any defect in the Seed ſown, the Seed being one and the ſame, but from the badneſs or goodneſs of the Soil; it ſhews that ſome hearers of the Goſpel would hear ſo, that their hearing would turn to a bleſſed account, others would hear without reaping any Soul benefit thereby.</p>
                  <p>So that theſe Scriptures ſpeak not any thing of God's intention of ſending Chriſt, and ſo the Goſpel into the World, but they ſhew how unworthily ſome Men will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves towards Chriſt, and the tenders of Salvation by the Goſpel, and what will be the end and effects the Goſpel will have upon thoſe that deſpiſe and reject it; for it is with the Goſpel preached, and the Gifts of Nature and Grace alſo, as it is with the good things of this Life, which are by the Lord given to the Children of Men, that ſo his bountifulneſs and goodneſs might lead them to repentance: but if their Table be a Snare, and their Proſperity their Ruin, 'tis through their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs and horrid impieties: ſo if the Goſpel hardens or blinds any, 'tis through the ill temper of Mens Hearts, and their deſperate obſtinacy to refuſe ſuch means of Salvation, and the ſeverity of God who giveth up obſtinate Men to their own hearts luſt, and in his juſt Judgment per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them to daſh againſt Chriſt, and other
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:35591:115"/> means of Salvation. What ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3, 4. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, 'tis hid to them that are loſt, whom the God of the World hath blinded their Eyes,</hi> that are alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the Life of God through the ignorance that is in them; and ſo give up themſelves to laſciviouſneſs, to work all uncleanneſs with greedineſs, and deſpiſe the Light of the Goſpel, cavil and quarrel at it: no wonder then that God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws his Spirit from ſtriving with them, and gives them up to their own hearts luſt: and if ever the Lord reſtrains the heavenly Influences of his Spirit, and withdraws his Bleſſing that uſually accompanies the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſincere preaching of the Goſpel, a ſtupid blindneſs muſt needs follow; ſo tho there be Preaching and Prayer and other Ordinances, yet when the preſence of God is not with them, there is no Milk in the Breaſt, and to ſuch 'tis all one as if there was none: nay as ſome the Goſpel enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, theſe it ſmites with blindneſs; as it ſoftens ſome, ſo it hardens theſe, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 26. <hi>make the Hearts of this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fat, and make their Ears heavy;</hi> as if the Lord ſhould have ſaid, Go and preach to this People, but preach them into hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and blindneſs; becauſe they refuſed to hear or ſee, let therefore the Light make them blind; and the Goſpel, which is the joyful ſound of Peace and Joy, make them
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:35591:115"/> deaf and ſtop their Ears; perſwade no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but make their Hearts fat, their Ears heavy, and ſhut their Eyes, that they may walk in their own counſel, and fill up the meaſure of their Iniquity. Wo to thoſe that God anſwers thus, to leave them to their own Hearts luſt; and ſay as once to <hi>Ephraim, Hoſea</hi> 4. <hi>Let him alone.</hi> If God deal thus with any, they indeed ſhall never melt at any Sermon, ſo as to awaken them out of their Sins; they will prove but deaf Adders that ſtop their Ears againſt all Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Charmers, tho never ſo wiſe.</p>
                  <p>But this God never did, nor never will do, but as the Fruit and Effect of provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sin and Diſobedience; for which ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 11. <hi>But my People would not hearken to my Voice; and Iſrael would have none of me; ſo I gave them up,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 42. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 24, 26. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4. 17.

                  <p>Why what ſhould I ſay to it? ſhall I ſay that God laid Chriſt in the way, and ſent his Word and Goſpel into the World, with an intent that moſt Perſons ſhould ſtumble at this Stone and be broken to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or that Chriſt died ſo far for all Men, that the Word might be preached to the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:35591:117"/> whole World, that ſo the greateſt part might ſtumble, diſobey, and reject Chriſt and the Goſpel? Should I ſay ſo, it would be a great impeachment of God's Juſtice and Holineſs, and would make him the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Sin and Diſobedience, ſo contrary to his Nature.</p>
                  <p>And I once again deſire you not to think that the bare naming a Text, or Texts of Scripture, enough to confirm an Opinion, but that you ſeriouſly mind the Context, with the ſenſe and drift of the Holy Ghoſt in the Text, and explain Scripture by Scripture; otherwiſe we may run our ſelves into a thouſand Miſunderſtandings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Analogy or Rule of Faith. Now if we compare this Text with what you have in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 47. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 6. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11. with many other places, you will find that neither Chriſt, nor the Goſpel, is ſent into the World intentionally for any to ſtumble and diſobey it, but Chriſt is to be preached and held forth by Goſpel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for the Salvation of all in the whole World that believe in him; as <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11. For <hi>the Grace of God that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared unto all Men,</hi> &amp;c. or as our old Tranſlation renders it, <hi>For that Grace of God which bringeth Salvation unto all Men, hath appeared.</hi> Here you may ſee that this Grace in the offers of it, and in the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, is of a ſaving tendency and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:35591:117"/> importance to all Men, and the ſavingneſs of it, and Salvation by it, is tendered alike to all Men: So that Chriſt came not into the World to be a Rock of Offence, at which the greateſt part of Men ſhould ſtumble and fall, but to ſhed his Blood for all Men; not only for thoſe that are ſaved, but alſo for thoſe which through unbelief and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency are not ſaved, <hi>John</hi> 3. 17.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, your Texts, if read in that Spirit in which they were wrote, ſhew you, that they were appointed or put to the Word, and they ſtumbled at that, and were diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to that; they ſtumbled at Chriſt and the Word out of ſtubbornneſs and wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not for want of Light. Mr. <hi>Loveday</hi> in his Expoſition on <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. pag. 33. ſaith, <q rend="inline">That Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> reads the words, That thoſe that are diſobedient to the Goſpel, and ſtand obſtinately againſt Chriſt, are thoſe who are by God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and declared ſo to ſtumble, as to be ruined by their obſtinacy.</q> So that diſobedience to the Goſpel is not to be imputed to the God of Heaven, but the God of this World, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. Neither muſt we think that Men ſtumbling at Chriſt, and being diſobedient to the Word, to which they were appointed to learn their Duty, is the Reſult of fatal Neceſſity. But prethee, <hi>Philetus,</hi> tell me whether you be of <hi>Moderatus</hi>'s mind, that Chriſt died
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:35591:118"/> ſo far for all, that the Goſpel, which is glad tidings, ſhould be preached to all; and whether the Lord by the preaching of the Goſpel doth not call all Men to Faith and Repentance, promiſing Salvation to all that do believe?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philet.</speaker>
                  <p>I know Faith and Repentance are required of all, and God by the Goſpel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites all Men to believe in him, promiſing Salvation to all that do ſo believe; yet only thoſe will believe for whom Chriſt died to purchaſe theſe things for them, and to purchaſe their Salvation; <hi>Ye believe not, becauſe you are not of my Sheep,</hi> John 10. 26.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>That is, I ſuppoſe, you mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not elected, and becauſe Chriſt did not die for them to purchaſe a Power to believe; and therefore they could not believe, becauſe God had decreed their unbelief: this is plainly to charge all the unbelief of Men upon the Lord; but ſaith Chriſt, <hi>They believe not, becauſe they were not of his Sheep:</hi> And who thoſe are he tells you in the next verſe, They are ſuch as hearing his Voice, follow him. Such fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious reaſoning ſtrikes at the Root of the Goſpel of Grace and free Love of God, and frees the Devil and wicked Men from bringing deſtruction on themſelves; for by ſuch Doctrine God Almighty is the ſole cauſe of all the incredulity in the World, and tho he offers and invites all Men to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:35591:118"/> of Grace, yet he doth it not really and in good earneſt: and while your Miniſters call upon Perſons to believe, and ſeem to wonder that they do not believe, and yet hold that God hath decreed they ſhall never believe, their Sermons are mere diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and nonſenſe. What would they bind Men to believe that which is untrue, and charge them to take and receive Chriſt as tendred to them in the Goſpel, and to believe there is remiſſion of Sins in Chriſt's Blood for them, when he never ſhed it for them, and ſo to lay hold upon that which they had no kind of intereſt in? This not only makes your Miniſters falſe Witneſſes, to offer Salvation to thoſe whoſe Damnation is abſolutely determined, but alſo makes God a mere deluder of miſerable Man, whom he calleth by the preaching of the Goſpel to partake of Salvation by his Son, and yet fully before intended their ruin. Is not this as much as in you lyeth, to make God a lier? as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 10. for they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not God, make him a lier, becauſe they believe not the Record God gave of his Son; and what is that, namely, That <hi>whoſoever believe on him ſhould not periſh, but have Everlaſting Life:</hi> not that any Man can poſſibly make God a Lier; no, let God be True, and all Men Liers; but Men by their not believing on Chriſt do repreſent God as untrue in his Word, becauſe they reject
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:35591:119"/> that as a Fable which hath been ſpoken by the Lord himſelf for a Truth; and thoſe that preach the glad-tidings of Grace and Peace to all Men, and every Creature, ſin in preaching, in that they preach Lies to moſt Men, yea and require Men to believe Lies. May we not eaſily ſee that all your Exhortations, Chidings, your whining, and ſeemingly bemoaning the ſtate of poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is but a diſſembling Art?</p>

                  <p>Yea, true Goſpel-Miniſters may; but what Pangs your Miniſters are in that hold Reprobation without reſpect to actual Sins part of their Creed, I know not; is commiſeration in you a Virtue, and is not all Good originally in God; and can I take your Miniſters to be filled with more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion than the God of Love, or to be better than they repreſent God to be? For do they not hold, that notwithſtanding all the paſſionate wiſhes of the Lord, his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations and Perſwaſions, Reprovings, Expoſtulations, mourning over the periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate of poor Sinners; yea, tho he uſeth Promiſes to allure them, and Threatnings to deter them, and calls all Men by the Goſpel to believe on his Son, that they may live through him, and ſwears that he wills not their Death: yet hath he by an eternal and uncontrolable Decree ſhut up
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:35591:119"/> the greateſt part of thoſe to whom theſe Tenders are made, under Sin and Miſery, that they ſhall never repent and be ſaved? Chriſt never died intentionally nor really to ſave them; they have thereby no more intereſt in him, than the fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and therefore there is no more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Goſpel ſhould be preached to the one more than the other; whereby it muſt needs follow that many Men by the Goſpel are bound in Conſcience to believe that which is untrue, and by your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters preſſed and charged to receive that which they have nothing to do with: by this you make the Lord guilty of the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſſimulation in his Promiſes and tenders of Grace to all. And, pray, what are your Miniſters but falſe Witneſſes, if they promiſe Salvation for all Men, when they believe there is no Salvation for far the greateſt part of Men, whom Chriſt never purchaſed by his Blood? If they exhort Sinners to turn from their Sins to the Lord, and promiſe them, that if they do ſo, they ſhall live, and tell all Men that God would not have one of them die in their Sins, but rather turn and live, is not this according to your Notion Lying? And do not they promiſe and undertake more in the behalf of God, than God himſelf is willing to perform? What a buſtle do your Miniſters keep, and to what purpoſe, unleſs to get
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:35591:120"/> Money, ſeeing the moſt powerful Miniſters and Sermons cannot in the leaſt alter the Intention of the Lord about the Salvation or Damnation of one Soul, Man's final and eternal State being fixed in Heaven?</p>
                  <p>And thus do you give the Truth of God the lie, and highly impeach the glorious Goſpel, and make your Miniſters teach nothing but abſurdities; nay, more than this, it overthrows not only his Goodneſs and Mercy, but alſo his Juſtice, that Men before they partake of the Breath of Life, or are any ways guilty of actual Sins, ſhould be ſo rigidly condemned to perpetual Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yea appointed to receive the Wages of Sin before they committed any; this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with common Juſtice and Equity amongſt Men: and <hi>Shall not the Judg of all the World do right?</hi> ſaid good <hi>Abraham</hi> to God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 25. And, ſaith <hi>Job, ſhall mortal Man be more juſt than God?</hi> and ſo our Apoſtle, <hi>Is there unrighteouſneſs with God? how then ſhall God judg the World?</hi> Doth it not wrong the pure Juſtice of God, to hold that he will judg and condemn Men for ever to lie under his Wrath for doing that which he himſelf decreed them to do, or that God Almighty ſhould behold Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in the Fall, and ſo totally deſert them without affording them a Saviour to believe in, or any power to believe, whereby they muſt unavoidably periſh; and yet at the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:35591:120"/> ſame time command all Men, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, to believe in his Son; <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 30. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 16, 17. and ſeverely threaten all thoſe that ſhall not believe on him, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>John</hi> 8. 24. <hi>John</hi> 3. 36. <hi>John</hi> 16. 9.</p>
                  <p>And Jeſus Chriſt not only commands all Men to repent and believe on him, and threatens all with Death that refuſe to believe, but alſo hath promiſed Life and Salvation to all without exception, which ſhall believe; <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. &amp; 11. 25, 26. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 6. And alſo by many ſweet encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging ways, labours to induce them to believe. Sometimes he preſents them with his great Love, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 4. ſometimes with his Mercy and tender Compaſſion, <hi>Exodus</hi> 34. 6. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 72. ſometimes with his delight in ſhewing Mercy, <hi>Micha</hi> 7. 18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. and with his deſire after their Salvation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. At other times with the great trouble of his Soul at their ſtubborn courſes, and that becauſe if they perſiſted in them, it would bring deſtruction to them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 31. <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 4. likewiſe ſhewing what Glory would accrue to them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 6, 12. Now to think, or ſay, that under all theſe Expreſſions of Love and Deſire to ſave Mankind, he hath paſt and ſealed a firm Decree in his Eternal Counſel to the contrary, is a great diſhonour done to God,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:35591:121"/> making him guilty of horrid and notorious Hypocriſy, to deſtroy his Creatures under the ſpecious pretence of Juſtice and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy; and as a great <note n="*" place="margin">The Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Speech.</note> Stateſman once ſaid, <hi>To kill by Forms and Subtilties of Law, is the worſt ſort of Murders.</hi> And to deſtroy Millions of Perſons under a colour of Mercy and Good-will, is like a Cat playing with a Mouſe, and making ſport with other Mens miſerys, and one of the greateſt Cruelties in the World; which Doctrine I am ſure is altogether inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with his incomprehenſible Juſtice.</p>

May not God, who is the Supreme Lord of all, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a free Benefit, without wrong to his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice?

                  <p>Moſt of this I have anſwered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and ſo ſhall ſay the leſs to it now: I believe that the God of Heaven is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely bound to any Man, but hath free liberty to diſpenſe his Favour where and to whom he will; yet hath he engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for our aſſiſtance (if we be not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our ſelves) to let in ſuch ſpiritual ſtrength as to inable us to perform that Duty that is required of us: the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways giveth ſtrength where he giveth a Command, or elſe the neglect of it will not be their condemnation; if it was not ſo, he would be, as the evil Servant ſtiled him, <hi>a hard Maſter, reaping where he hath not ſawed,</hi> &amp;c. or like <hi>Pharaoh</hi> whom God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as a Tyrant, to deny Straw, and yet require the tale of Brick; to require obedience to his Divine Will, and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſupernatural Grace, without which it was impoſſible for them to keep it. But if your Doctrine be true, Perſons are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to believe, and are condemned for not believing, and yet God hath ſhut them under unbelief, they have no power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and God hath decreed they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have a power to believe whilſt they live; nay, he not only denys a Power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but a Chriſt to believe in: the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of Men have no more part in Chriſt, and the Covenant of Grace, than
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:35591:122"/> the Devils have; and yet the Goſpel is to be preached to all for the obedience of Faith. Is not this a piece of the higheſt Blaſphemy, making the great Creator as vile and treacherous as a Creature; yea, to make the Almighty ſubject to the moſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Art of Flattery, pretending one thing, when the contrary is really intended? as if the Lord deſigned to ſport himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

What tho the Lord, according to his manifold Wiſdom, is pleaſed to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe a greater ſufficiency of means to know the Lord, and to know what God hath done for them, and by the Goſpel reveals thoſe things, which otherwiſe in an ordinary way could not be known to one Nation, or one Age and Generation of Men more than another; yet knowing, and by daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience finding God to be infinite in Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mercy, I cannot but believe he hath effectually provided for their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as well as ours, tho the ordinary means is wanting, as at this day in many parts of the World: for tho Faith is not now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in them by preaching and hearing, as with us at this day; yet God hath many ways to inſtruct, and communicate his Will
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:35591:124"/> to Man, <hi>Job</hi> 33. yea to reveal Chriſt in ſuch manner and ways as may be available; for Jeſus Chriſt, who took Man's Nature upon him, and who hath taken away their original Guilt, and who <hi>enlightens every Man that comes into the World,</hi> may, by the Operation of his Spirit (how and when he pleaſeth) ſo help them to improve their ſingle Talent of Reaſon, and the Light ſet up in their Conſciences, which may ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect what is wanting of the ordinary means, <hi>that many</hi> thouſands, according to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>ſhall come from the Eaſt and the Weſt, and ſit down with</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> when the Children of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Kingdom, or Church, who judged themſelves the ſole Inheritors of it, and all the reſt of the World but Caſtaways, ſhall be ſhut out: and if you look <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. you may ſee that thoſe that had their natural Birth in <hi>Rahab, Tyre, Ethiopia, Philiſtia, Babylon,</hi> ſhall be accounted as born in the Spiritual <hi>Zion,</hi> or Church of God.</p>

                  <p>I rather think that Chriſt ſpoke it of the Kingdom of Grace, or the Viſible Church of Chriſt, that none could not, or at leaſt wiſe ought not come into it without Regeneration and holy Baptiſm; yet may a Perſon be a Member of the Univerſal Church, yea and be received a Member of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Church in Heaven, that may not be a Member of the Viſible Church of Chriſt here on Earth: for there are two ſorts of Perſons that cannot (in an ordinary way) be regenerated and born again, which yet may and ſhall go to Heaven, to wit, Children and Idiots. So tho it is a truth, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Jeſus Chriſt there can be no Salvation; yet if there is no Salvation without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on the Name of the Lord Jeſus, what then will become of theſe, and all dying Infants, who neither have Faith, nor are regenerated? and yet they ſhall have Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by him. Now as God hath one way to bring Perſons of Age to Heaven, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to bring infants, why may not thoſe that never had the means to know the Mediator particularly and diſtinctly, have Salvation by him? Infants, and thoſe many millions of Heathens in ſome remote parts of the Earth, to whom the Goſpel was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preached, muſt unavoidablely and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally periſh, if God hath provided no other means of Salvation by Chriſt, than ſuch a way of preaching it, as is vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:35591:127"/> to us. We know that the Judgment of God will be according to Equity: he knows what he hath laid down, what he hath given, and what to require, and how to reward every Man according to his Works; and his Mercys are infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended over all his Works; and he is not ſo ſevere as to exact more than frail Man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to perform, but according to what light and knowledg he hath given him; and whoſoever worſhip God, and do his Will, according to the manifeſtation which he hath given them of his Will, ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 34, 35. He that improves one Talent well, ſhall be accepted as well as he that improves five; for ſurely the Almighty will never require any more of a Man than he hath given him: therefore I believe that all thoſe that are obedient to that Light or Law which the Lord hath given them, endeavouring according to their meaſure an exact conformity to the Divine Will, ſhall be happy; and it would be a great piece of uncharitableneſs to exclude them from all intereſt in Chriſt, and to allow none to have any ſaving benefit by Chriſt's Death but ſuch as own the <hi>true Orthodox Faith</hi> (as it is called by ſome) we may by this damn by wholeſale, not only all the <hi>Gentile</hi> Nations, but alſo moſt other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who have erred in Judgment, and have unwittingly miſtaken the Truth,

                  <p>The firſt is this, That Chriſt died for thoſe that miſs Salvation through unbelief; for if the Lord by the Goſpel promiſed Salvation to all Men, without exception, in caſe they do believe on Chriſt (which you cannot deny) it roundly follows that Chriſt muſt needs have purchaſed it for them by his Blood; for there is no Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without Remiſſion of Sins, nor no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion without ſhedding of Blood: neither could their believing procure any other Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to them, but only that which was fully purchaſed for them by the Blood of Chriſt, there being no Salvation for any Man upon any Terms or Conditions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, unleſs Chriſt hath purchaſed it for them by his Blood. Therefore unleſs you do ſuppoſe that Chriſt ſhed his Blood for all, you cannot ſay with any truth, that if they believe they ſhall be ſaved: Can you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that their believing, or not believing,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:35591:132"/> ſhould any ways alter the Lord's Intentions concerning them in the Death of Chriſt, or cauſe them to be bought with his Blood, which were not bought before? or whether doth the Lord in the Goſpel aſſure Perſons of ſuch a Salvation which was never ſo much as intended to be purchaſed for them? This would be to repreſent the Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly unlike himſelf, which none dare affirm that have any regard to the Honour and Glory of God.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is this, That thoſe that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh through unbelief, were through Grace put in a poſſibility of believing and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Chriſt as tendered to them. God will not condemn Souls for not believing that which was impoſſible for them to believe. If unbelief be the condemning Sin, and that Men are condemned for not believing, it follows againſt all contradiction, that all Men at one time or another are put into ſuch a capacity, as that thro the Grace of God they may be ſaved. Thus have you in a few words pull'd down with your own hands the main building which you have in your Diſcourſe this day laboured to make ſtand. But is this your uſual way, to do and undo? Have you not told us, that God gave not his Son to die for all, and yet he offers his Grace to all; and that there is no Univerſal Redemption, and yet Chriſt is univerſally tendered to all; that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:35591:133"/> not only the Suffering, but the Sins of the Reprobates, and yet their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of themſelves; that Men miſs Salvation becauſe of unbelief, yet God never gave them a power to believe, nor a Chriſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in; and that Men muſt ſtrive to lay hold upon Chriſt, and come up to the terms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Salvation is tendred and promiſed, and yet have no power to do it, but are as paſſive as Stones or dead Men: How can you make theſe things ſtand together?</p>

                  <p>This term of Free-will is made uſe of by almoſt every captious Perſon, and caſt as Dung in the Face of many of the Lord's People; and that by many that know not what they mean by it. I have often heard Free-will mentioned by the Tongues, and in the Books of thoſe of your way, yet I never, to my knowledg, found it defined; but ſurely as you hold it, or ſuppoſe others to hold it, it is ſome vile Opinions indeed: would any elſe call it <hi>curſed Free-will;</hi> and thoſe that they think hold it, <hi>damned Free-willers;</hi> or in their Prayers deſire that God would confound all that hold it?</p>

                  <p>Well, but now I find Free-will as much owned by thoſe of your way, as by any that I know amongſt us; for the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Divines, in their <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> Chap. 9. expreſly ſay, <q rend="inline">God hath indued the Will of Man with that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Liberty, that it is neither forced, nor by any abſolute neceſſity of Nature determined to do good or evil.</q> And Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Preface to his <hi>Call to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconverted,</hi> ſpeaks thus, <q rend="inline">For Free-will, <hi>Origen</hi> is condemned by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> for ſaying, Man had loſt the Image of God: this Image is twofold; 1ſt. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that is, Reaſon and Free-will. 2ly. Qualitative, that is, our Holineſs; this is loſt, and by Grace reſtored.</q> And he farther ſaith, <q rend="inline">That <hi>Auſtin</hi> as well as <hi>Pelagius, Calvin</hi> as well as the <hi>Arminians,</hi> the <hi>Dominicans</hi> as well as the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> all generally maintain, that Man hath Free-will.</q> Yea, he tells us, <q rend="inline">no Man of Brains can deny that Man hath a Will naturally free, and is a ſelf-determining Principle, tho not freed from evil diſpoſitions.</q> Can you name any amongſt us that hold more than theſe your Brethren hold? For what can theſe mean by it leſs than this, that the Will of Man now after the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> in natural Actions, is as
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:35591:134"/> free as ever it was? for tho by the Fall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> all the Faculties of the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Judgment, Affections, Underſtanding. Will, Power, and Freedom to act, are greatly bruiſed, much weakned and dulled, yet not one of them is wholly loſt; and indeed the Soul would be a nothing if it be denied the uſe of its Faculties; for as the Body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit is dead, and remains a life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Bulk, even ſo is the Soul if it doth not exert it ſelf in the various actings and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of its Power: and indeed if we have not a Free-will in a ſufficient Meaſure, to do or leave undone, chuſe or refuſe, then were our Faculties inferiour to thoſe of Beaſts, who do chuſe, or leave, ſuch means of preſervation as are ſet before them; and as the Will of Man in natural Actions is free, even ſo it is as really free in ſpiritual, when it is made ſo by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Grace of God; or elſe how ſhould we run the ways of God's Commandments, if we have not the liberty of our Souls, and will to do it?</p>
                  <p>Therefore when you curſe and damn Free-will, and Free-willers at that rate as you do, you muſt ſurely mean ſomething elſe than what your Friends mean, or what I mentioned laſt; pray tell me what it is.</p>

                  <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, you ſay, Men may be ſaved if they will; which is ſo groſs an Error, that they muſt be very blind that cannot
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:35591:134"/> ſee it; for if it was ſo, Men might have Heaven for willing, and none would go to Hell: but <hi>it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that ſheweth Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> Rom. 9. 16.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>That's true, if Men might have Heaven for wiſhing or willing, few would be ſo fool-hardy as to go to Hell: Who would, but with <hi>Balaam, die the Death of the Righteous?</hi> Who would but have all Tears wiped away from their Eyes, and live in Bliſs and Glory, if God would ſave Perſons for their good Wiſhes and Deſires, and give them Heaven tho they never minded it all their days ſo as to pleaſe God? they deſerve to go to Hell, that would not have Heaven upon this account, that think Heaven not worth a Wiſh. And as to your Scriptures, the Apoſtle ſheweth that the <hi>Jews</hi> had a Will to be ſaved; and the reaſon why they fell ſhort of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was not for want of willing or run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but for not willing and running in a right way; they ſought it not by Faith, but by the Works of the Law: <hi>They being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of God's Righteouſneſs, and going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to eſtabliſh their own,</hi> Rom. 10. 3. ſo miſt of Juſtification: But ſurely this is not that Free-will you ſo much cry out of; for where can you find ſuch Free-willers that hold Heaven may be had for wiſhing for?</p>

                  <speaker>Philet.</speaker>
                  <p>But however you hold, that you have naturally ſuch a power and freedom of Will, that when you would do good you can.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis a miſtake, we do not ſay we have it from Nature, but from Grace; for as we are in our depraved Nature, we can neither do nor will ought that is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and good: but as in Grace we may, for then to will is preſent with us; yea, and ever ſince the Promiſe was made, that <hi>the Seed of the Woman ſhould bruiſe the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's Head,</hi> the Lord doth firſt or laſt enlighten every Man that cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, vouchſaſing ſuch renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Will, and ſuch a perpetual co-aſſiſtance to perform what ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, if perſons do not wilfully, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, and finally reſiſt his Grace; ſo that none of our Sins can juſtly be charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any deficiency in him: Our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour tells them, the Word was near them, and in them; and that he was the Light that enlightens every Man.</p>
                  <p>Yet if by Free-will you mean a ſingle Power in the Creature to convert it ſelf: I know none this day in <hi>England</hi> that hold ſuch an Opinion; however I utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſuch an Opinion as vile, it being to aſcribe too much to humane Nature. It muſt needs be a pernicious Principle for any to believe, that a Man by the ſole power of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:35591:135"/> regulating of his own Will and Reaſon, can obtain Eternal Salvation; this would make the ſuffering of Chriſt altogether fruitleſs: and I believe alſo that none hath any will or power of himſelf, without God, to do any thing that's good; or to attain to a ſupernatural End, but by the Aſſiſtance of Divine Grace: and therefore there is an abſolute neceſſity of ſeeking and imploring the ſaving ſupernatural aid and help of the Spirit of that God, from whom all our Abilities are derived to us. And as to what you ſay we hold, that when we would do good, we can: I ſay, that through the Grace of God we may avoid many more Sins than we daily do avoid, and do more good than we do: tell me, are any of us laid under a neceſſity of ſinning? cannot we forbear many Sins which we daily run into? and do we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do what God by his Grace hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred us to do in our Duty to God and Man, and in avoiding Sin? If you ſay we can do no otherwiſe, then is all your preaching vain, yea ridiculous; for if an irreſiſtible Cauſe overpower us, that we can do no otherwiſe, no Man that is truly maſter of his own Reaſon, will ever ſpend his time and ſtrength to exhort any to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of doing that which they could not but do, or omitting of that which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in their power to effect. If you ſay,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:35591:136"/> that by the Grace of God we may do the one or the other, you own Free-will as much as I.</p>
                  <p>For this is the Free-will (if we may call it ſo) that I hold, <hi>viz.</hi> That God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath (of his Free Love and Grace) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted a meaſure of himſelf, or endowed Mankind with thoſe Abilities to perform whatſoever he requires of them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins them to; God never gives a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but he gives a Power, or elſe their Diſobedience ſhall not be their Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: if this be a vile Opinion, then I confeſs I am vile; for if God requires us to believe, and yet adminiſters not ſufficient Grace and Strength to believe, all our endeavours are vain and fruitleſs; Men cannot make Brick till Srraw be given them: for the Lord to preſcribe Dutys to us, and annex Penaltys upon the non-performance of them, as to puniſh with Eternal Death all thoſe that are diſobedient to his Will, and yet to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his Grace and Aſſiſtance, without which it is impoſſible to keep them; this is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Lord (as I once ſaid before) too much like cruel <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that made the Lives of his People bitter to them, by laying heavy Burdens, in requiring the tale of Brick, and yet denying Straw, the fit Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials; or as the evil Servant in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtiled him, <hi>a hard Maſter, reaping where he hath not ſowed.</hi>

                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>Why then Man can have no more Sin nor Righteouſneſs in him than a Stone: if Man in the Work of Converſion be like a Stock or Stone, merely paſſive, doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; then in Converſion Perſons nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hear, nor repent, nor turn from Sin to the Lord, nor believe in Chriſt: and how any are truly regenerated without
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:35591:137"/> thoſe, I know not; and if theſe are to be done in Converſion, pray who is active in this Work, if the Party regenerated be not?</p>
                  <p>And if by God's Free Grace Man hath not the leaſt power of his Will, but is merely paſſive in all; why then ſhould the Lord ſo paſſionately complain of Mens ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy? and why did Chriſt wonder at the unbelief of many? <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 6. Here was not the leaſt cauſe for Chriſt to marvel at the unbelief of any, when it never was in their power to believe, unleſs Chriſt ſhould wonder that Man ſhould act and do more than he had power to do, or more than all the Creatures in Heaven or Earth could enable him to do. Nay, if Men be wholly as paſſive as Stones, and can neither repent nor believe, by means of thoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities vouchſafed to them by the Lord, then can no reward nor puniſhment be juſtly awarded to any Man for believing or not believing: for if Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be wrought in Man only by the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent and Irreſiſtible Power of God, without Man, then cannot that Obedience be a free Obedience: and in vain is it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of Man, when it is to be wrought by ſuch a Force as cannot be reſiſted; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any Man be rewarded as one truly and really obedient. And in this caſe we may ſafely affirm, that the Lord rewards
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:35591:137"/> himſelf, and not the Man who is truly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, doing nothing; or if any thing, 'tis purely effected by the Force of another: for what things are produced in us by God's irreſiſtible Omnipotency without us, cannot of right come under the name of Obedience, and therefore cannot juſtly be rewarded, or judged worthy of any commendation. <hi>Remonſtrants Confeſſion,</hi> pag. 148. Alſo Eternal Puniſhment is unjuſtly and cruelly inflicted on him that doth not repent and believe, when he had no power to do either: but the want of it was through the alone defect of irreſiſtible Grace; and ſhould the Lord puniſh Men for not repenting and believing, he ſhould puniſh them for not attempting to make themſelves equal in Power with himſelf; and then, pray, to what purpoſe are all the inviting Promiſes of Life and Glory, and all the Dangers that Souls expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to, expreſſed in the Scripture, and preſſed ſo much by your Preachers, if we through Grace have not power to obtain the one, or eſcape the other?</p>
                  <p>Very well ſaith S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> as quoted by Dr. <hi>Goodman</hi> in his <hi>Parable of the Prodigal Son,</hi> p. 100. <q rend="inline">God bound not Man under the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid Bonds of Neceſſity, whereby he ſhould be forcibly over-ruled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to one thing, but put him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <p>It's rather an honouring of him, by laying all the blame of our Miſdoings upon our ſelves, and acknowledging his free Grace, in giving us not only time, but abilities and means to know the Lord, and to cleave to him, and to work with God when he is pleaſed to be moving upon our Hearts, Wills, and Conſciences, by his Divine Grace, that ſo we might be curbed and reſtrained from being carried head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into deſtruction by the ſway of our unruly Luſts.</p>

                  <p>Yea, that which I affirm is as depreſſive of the Creature, and as exaltive of God's Glory as what you hold, nay more (as I ſhall make appear by and by) Where have I ſaid, that we are able to do any thing that's good, to repent, believe, or obey the Lord, and ſerve him acceptably, by our own natural ſtrength, without the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual aſſiſtance of Divine Grace? I ſay, this is not poſſible now for Man in his lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſtate, tho it be generally held, that Man had at the firſt a perfect liberty to ſtand or fall in an equal poſſibility of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or not ſinning. If this were ſo, then his condition was <hi>in Aequilibrio,</hi> and it was in the Creatures choice to turn the Scales: but long he did not ſtand in this equal State, for being tempted to aſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his place, at the very firſt onſet, at the firſt temptation he loſt his Innocency, and fell into a depraved State, and ſo his Will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came infirm relation to its acting for Virtue and Goodneſs. But now God having pity on fallen Man, in his infinite Goodneſs and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom found out a way to reſtore him to a more noble and excellent State than <hi>Adam</hi> injoyed, which was by the promiſed Seed; and what perfection the Will had in the ſtate of perfect Nature, is reſtored by the Spirit of Grace. So that a good and real Chriſtian may be ſaid to injoy as free a Will by Grace ſince the Fall, as <hi>Adam</hi> had
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:35591:139"/> by Nature before the Fall; John 8. 36. <hi>If the Son make you free, you ſhall be free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi>

                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:35591:139"/> 29. 11, to 17.

But it is, as I ſaid before, wholly to be aſcribed to the Grace of God in Chriſt as the principal and primary Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Now as to Faith and Repentance being the Gift of God, this is a truth: God is ſaid to give Faith and Repentance, yea, to intend the Salvation of all Men, when he vouchſafeth a ſufficiency of means. Now Faith is taken many ways; ſometimes, and very frequently, 'tis taken for the Goſpel, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 23. So it is the Gift of God, and he is ſaid to give Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance when he gives the Goſpel, which is the Word of Faith; and ſo Faith is the Gift of God; and when any Soul is by the goodneſs of God led to repentance, God is ſaid to give Repentance. Alſo God gives the power or ability to repent and believe, or elſe Man could do neither; yet doth not God's Grace deſtroy our Duty, tho God gives not only Grace neceſſary, but alſo ſufficient for yielding Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: yet the Act or Duty of believing is not God's Work, but Man's, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>James</hi> 3. 2. And the Perſon that is regenerate, muſt be ſo far active in
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:35591:140"/> the Work, that the Work it ſelf may be as truly and properly aſcribed unto Man, and called his, as it is aſcribed to God, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Gift: now this you muſt believe, unleſs you have ſo far forſaken your Reaſon, as to ſay, that Chriſt acts the Creature's Actions, and ſo Jeſus Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and Jeſus Chriſt believes, and Man doth nothing. But ſurely we ſtand bound to believe, repent, and obey the Lord if we expect Salvation; theſe are our own acts, and 'tis impoſſible they ſhould be the acts of Chriſt; for he that is ſaid to act any action, is ſaid to do it. Now if when we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to do theſe Duties, Chriſt ſhould do them for us while we ſit ſtill; what ſenſe muſt we make of Scripture? muſt Jeſus Chriſt break off his Sins by Repentance, and amend his evil ways and doings? or muſt Chriſt believe in Chriſt, or walk in the ſteps of Chriſt? And from hence it will infallibly follow, that Perſons ſhall be damned, becauſe God did not only make them Believers by an irreſiſtible Power, but alſo act their Work too. Saith <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>If ye through the Spirit,</hi> not the Spirit without you, nor ye without the Spirit; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that Man muſt be an Agent in the Work, it muſt be his own act, and therefore he is not wholly paſſive: neither have we ground to believe God will work theſe in ſuch a way as ſhall be impoſſible to be fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated.</p>

                  <p>As for your urging Chriſt and <hi>Lazarus</hi> being both dead, to prove Perſons as unable to act in Converſion, it is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: for tho the Lord in raiſing up Chriſt did the work wholly of himſelf by his mighty Power, neither was <hi>Lazarus</hi> able to act any thing in the Grave towards reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Life; yet in the Work of converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Lord comes to a Creature which he hath by free Grace furniſhed with Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to do what he requires of him. And <hi>Lazarus</hi> after he heard the Voice of the Lord, and received Life, was active, and came forth; and ſo when Perſons hear the Voice of the Lord, and are thereby raiſed from a death in Sin, or a deadly cuſtom of Sinning, to live ſoberly, juſtly, and godly, this is ſaid to be a raiſing from the Dead, and a new Creation begotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and by Faith and Repentance making new Creatures: tho the Lord beſtoweth Grace ſufficient for the yielding to the Voice of the Lord when he calleth them by the Goſpel, yet through the alone proper fault of Man it becomes unfruitful; for the Lord doth not uſually come to Perſons in ſuch a mighty Whirlwind, as 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 11. to
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:35591:142"/> force their conſent, and carry them head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to their duty, and irreſiſtibly compel them to embrace eternal Happineſs, and ſhew ſuch a Miracle of his mighty Power, as he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the dead, or upon <hi>Lazarus</hi> when he had lain four days dead in the Grave.</p>
                  <p>Now it is true, the Power by which Chriſt and <hi>Lazarus</hi> were raiſed from the Dead was irreſiſtible, neither were they able to oppoſe it; but thoſe ways which the Lord uſually takes to bring Mens Wills in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a compliance with his own, is not ſo ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible that they cannot any ways oppoſe it. How very frequently have Perſons grieved the Spirit of God, and reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt, and prefer'd a darling Sin, and a beloved Corruption, before the Grace of God? but you ſeem to hold that no Sinner is converted without ſuch an Omnipotent Power put forth for his converſion as was wrought in Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reſiſted; but this is more than you can prove, either in your own conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or any others. Tho you ſometimes tell us how paſſive Perſons are in Converſion, yet at other times you make Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance two parts of Regeneration; and how Perſons can be ſaid to have either, and yet be paſſive, neither I nor you know. Beſides, when thoſe of your way give us an account of the Converſion of others, they
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:35591:142"/> tell us of the frequent reſiſting the Lord's ſtriving with them, and the great wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings which have been between Faith and Reaſon, Fleſh and Spirit, and the many Prayers, Tears and Agonys Perſons have gon through before the new Birth hath been compleated.</p>
                  <p>Pray do but conſider what Mr. <hi>Keach</hi> hath written in his <hi>Travels of true Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi>

                  <p>I know and believe that <hi>Paul</hi>'s Converſion was effected in a very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, and as miraculous as any we
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:35591:144"/> hear or read of; Chriſt himſelf appearing from Heaven, and ſpeaking by audible Voice to him: neither do I deny but God may ſtill, if he pleaſe, and no queſtion doth in ſome ſpecial Caſes, and in order to ſome great and ſpecial End, open the Hand of his Bounty much wider to ſome in the vouchſafement of the Means of Grace and Salvation, than ordinarily he doth to others. Yet to ſay all Converſion is ſo miraculous, or that God doth as much for the Converſion of every one that's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, as he did for <hi>Paul,</hi> is not true; neither can you prove that <hi>Paul</hi>'s Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was perfected by the Viſion; for 'tis plain he was directed to <hi>Ananias</hi> to be farther inſtructed in thoſe things that did relate to the Goſpel, and what he was far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do.

                  <p>I do not find this term, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating Grace, in the Scripture; Grace properly ſignifies Love and Kindneſs, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and friendly Acceptance: and as for free-Love, free-Kindneſs, free-Favour, and free-Acceptance, there is nothing more required, but that it be not deſerved, for that is undoubtedly free that is undeſerved: ſo that what we do, or can do, doth not in the leaſt oblige the Lord to beſtow any Love or Favour upon us (which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed it cannot) ſtill that of the Apoſtle will ſtand good, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>By Grace you are ſaved, through Faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the Gift of God.</hi> So that all boaſting is excluded, ſince we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not change our Hearts, cannot repent of our Sins, or believe on him by virtue of our own natural Abilities, but by the aid and aſſiſtance of Divine Grace. Man's Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Felicity is derived from God, and we live daily in a neceſſary dependance upon him for his Grace, and the Aid of his Holy
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:35591:145"/> Spirit to repair our Strength, and aſſiſt our Faculties, and every way to enable us to perform thoſe Duties which are due to ſo Sovereign a Lord, and as it becometh Creatures to do.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſtill we are to remember that his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting Grace doth not deſtroy our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; for as we can do nothing without God, ſo he will do nothing for us without our ſelves; and as <hi>God works in us to will and to do,</hi> &amp;c. ſo Perſons are <hi>to work out their own Salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> and not think to ſit ſtill and take their eaſe, and live in a carnal ſtate, without improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe means that God hath vouchſafed them to repent and believe, till the Lord by an irreſiſtible Power pluck them out of their Sins. This we are not to expect, neither are we to thank our ſelves if we be ſaved, but God's free Love and Bounty is to be acknowledged the ſole cauſe of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; neither can it be any diminution to Divine Goodneſs to ſay, that unleſs Man doth concur with the firſt Cauſe, the End cannot be obtained, ſince Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and Obedience to the Lord, is made a condition with reference to Eternal Life. Suppoſe a Prince ſhould ſee one that has ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otouſly miſpent his Portion in great want, and he out of his free Bounty ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him a Sum of Money ſufficient to ſupply all his Wants, diſcharge all his
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:35591:145"/> Debts, free him from all fear of Arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and enrich him for ever in this World, provided he will but come to him, and put forth his hand to receive this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, he ſhall have it; if he will not, he will give it to thoſe that will: Will any ſay that this was no free act of Love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it had ſuch Conditions propounded with it? or if any one ſhould refuſe ſo kind an Offer, tho upon ſuch terms as theſe, and will not come to him, nor put forth his hand to receive any of his Gold or Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but will rather pine away or rot in a Goal, unleſs he will force it into his Pocket whether he will or no; would not all People look upon this as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt folly and imprudence in the World? What, be loaded with Bags of Gold and Silver, and diſcharged from all Wants and Fears, and yet not ſo much as reach out the hand to receive them? Well, ſuppoſe he ſhould put forth his hand to receive this Treaſure, is it the act of receiving the Money, or the Money received that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richeth him? ſurely tho his putting forth his hand was a means, yet it was the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny received that inriched him, and he had cauſe for ever to be thankful to him, and admire his Love, and Bounty, and free Gift; here would be no cauſe for ſuch a poor Wretch to pride up himſelf, as if by his own power and towardlineſs he had
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:35591:146"/> merited ſuch Grace and Favour, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the contrary: ſo in ſpirituals. O here will be enough for Souls to admire, and that to Eternity, the ſignal Acts of God's free Grace and Favour, in that he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſuch effectual Means, and afforded them ſo powerful Aids and Aſſiſtances, in order to make them holy, and to bring their Wills into a compliance with his own. And I deſire you to conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will not be an aggravation to the damned to think, that they might have been happy as well as others, but that they wilfully refuſed Grace and Mercy when it was tendered to them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Now if Converſion is to be wrought only by the irreſiſtible and unfruſtrable Power of Grace; why is it ſaid that ſome reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt, and made void the Counſel of God againſt themſelves, and would not hear, come, nor obey his Voice, but cloſed their Ears, and hardned their Hearts? as may be ſeen <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 51. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 30. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 46. &amp; 7. 39. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24, 25. <hi>Zac.</hi> 7. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 7. and of others, that they heard the word readily, and received it chearfully, and obeyed it from the heart, as <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. &amp; 13. 47. &amp; 6. 7. &amp; 17. 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17. Now how can any of theſe be attributed to thoſe who either can no ways believe and obey, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly above their power; or could

                  <p n="2">2. But again, if God by a ſtrong hand of irreſiſtible Grace works converſion in all, then all the Exhortations, Threatnings, and Promiſes, made unto Sinners in order to their repentance and believing are made in vain, yea bootleſs and ridiculous. <q rend="inline">The Divine Decree doth not impoſe any real and fatal neceſſity on any, in reſpect of their eternal ſafety or ruin; for the Voice of Reaſon muſt needs proclaim thoſe Laws and Conſtitutions unjuſt, which plainly forbid and prohibit that which a Man cannot poſſibly aſſume or avoid, nor can no more be changed by our moſt earneſt endeavours, than we can ſtay the courſe of the Heavens, or fly in the Air.</q> Mr. <hi>Hockins</hi> on <hi>God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,</hi> p. 122.</p>

                  <p>God is not the Author of Sin in any: for tho Sin will infallibly follow this Preterition, or non-Election, with a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of aſſiſting Grace; it follows not as an Effect from its true Cauſe, but as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence upon its Antecedent. Hence he is no more the Author of Sin, than the Sun is of the Darkneſs which follows after its departure; for this Preterition reſpects Man lying in the corrupt Maſs, and God ows nothing to him but Juſtice; Grace comes down from Heaven, but Sin and Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity grows at home in the Sinner's own Heart: neither was God any ways obliged to give reſtituent Grace to fallen Man, God may do what he will with his own; may not the Supreme Lord deny a free Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, without being the Author of Sin?

                  <p>I ſhall not trouble my ſelf about the diſtinction of God's Will into Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Conſequent, (being made uſe of more to ſhew Scholarſhip than to Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) yet it is likely it may be found in ſundry places of Holy writ: for Grace, and the means of Salvation, are always in the firſt place vouchſafed unto Men before Salvation or Condemnation is actually conferred or inflicted upon any. God's Antecedent Will is, that every Man ſhould repent, that they may not periſh; it is his conſequent Will that every one ſhall periſh that will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: yet is the Antecedent and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Will or Intention of the Lord both equally Eternal, equally Honourable and worthy of him.</p>
                  <p>But now what you hold in this caſe is not ſo, it being contrary to right Reaſon, and the tenour of God's Word; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding your diſtinction, God muſt become the proper and direct cauſe of Sin; for Sin and Diſobedience muſt unavoidably follow God's detaining Grace neceſſary for the avoiding of Sin, as the Effect doth its Cauſe. Now if God withhold Grace needful for the avoiding of Sin, and knowing infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly what will follow upon it, muſt needs be the true moral Cauſe of Sin, for the withdrawing of Divine Grace you hold is the Antecedent, then Sin and Impiety muſt needs be the Conſequent: as the Sun by
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:35591:148"/> withdrawing its Light, Darkneſs conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently follows; ſo if God be the chief Cauſe of that which is the Cauſe of the Reprobates Sin (which you do not deny) he thereby becomes the true and proper cauſe of their Sin, as you have it in <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Love to Mankind,</hi> p. 115, 116. <q rend="inline">That which withholdeth a thing, which being preſent would hinder an Event, is the Cauſe of that Event: As for Example, He that cutteth a ſtring in which a Stone hangs, is the cauſe of the falling of that Stone; and he that withdraweth a Pillar which being put to, would uphold a Houſe, is the true cauſe, in Mens account, of the falling of that Houſe: and ſo if God withholdeth from Reprobates that Power which being granted them might keep them from falling into Sin, he doth thereby become a true moral cauſe of their Sins: in whoſe Power it is that a thing be not done, to him it is imputed when it is done, ſaith <hi>Tertullian.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, and by this, Sin, if it was Sin, could not become worthy of Eternal Puniſhment; for certainly God will not inflict Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Man for that which he himſelf was Author of, and which Man could not poſſibly avoid, being neceſſitated thereunto by a fatal Decree. I do grant you, God owes nothing to any Man, I alſo grant you that Grace comes down from Heaven, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 17.
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:35591:149"/> and that Sin and Iniquity grows at home in the Sinners own Heart; yea, the beſt of Men are exceeding prone to Sin by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of their Natures, yet none are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to Sin from any withdrawings of Divine Grace, unleſs firſt abuſed; neither doth the Lord deny his Grace to any, but to thoſe who too often and preſumptuouſly abuſe it; neither can you prove in God's Revealed Will, that he hath either antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently or conſequently paſſed any Decree upon any Man perſonally conſidered, there by excluding him from Salvation, before he voluntarily excludes himſelf by ſuch ſinful miſcarriages, which render him utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable thereof.</p>
                  <p>But to return to what we were upon; And,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If Perſons be not by Grace put in a capacity to believe and obey the Lord, they thereby become excuſable if they do not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey; becauſe the Plea of inſufficiency, or want of Power to believe, is an excuſe poſſible: but ſurely the Means and Power which through Grace the Lord hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to Men, will leave them without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, if they prove wicked and unbelievers; they will have nothing to plead for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when they come to ſtand before the Tribunal Seat of Chriſt, but will be as ſpeechleſs as the Gueſt was without a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Garment: for if the Heathens be
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:35591:149"/> without excuſe, in that they did not glorify the Lord by the means vouchſafed to them, how inexcuſable ſhall all thoſe be, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der greater Mens and Light ſhall prove wicked and ungodly? which could not be if the Lord had not granted a power to do better. And I deſire you to conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you believe any Man ſhall be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for not doing of that which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to do,</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If ſuch as die in their Sins through unbelief have not through Grace a ſufficient power to repent and believe in order to their Salvation, then doth God in his moſt earneſt inviting them to believe, rather inſult over them in their weakneſs and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, than intend any real benefit to them; which to conceive, is moſt unworthy of him, and not far from blaſphemy: for doth not this your Opinion repreſent God full of guile?</p>

                  <p>Now thus to profeſs Love to Man, and be earneſt with him to do that for his ſafety, which he knows to be impoſſible for him to do, looks too much like Guile diſguiſed under a Mask of Candor and Goodneſs,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:35591:150"/> which is far from him to be guilty of.</p>
                  <p>And pray you to what end are all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in Scriptures; are they not to ſpur us on to a holy and pious Life? but how vain are they, when they are upon condition of our repentance, believing and obeying the Lord, which is as poſſible to perform with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Grace, as to eat up a Rock? Now if God makes a promiſe to give us Heaven on condition we do believe, and yet never gives us a Chriſt to believe in, nor power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, theſe are Promiſes equal to a bare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial: but far be it from the moſt High, that any of his Promiſes ſhould be either falſe or fraudulent; his Promiſes are in Chriſt <hi>Yea, and Amen;</hi> they are as unchangeable as his being, they are not fair to look on (like the Apples of <hi>Sodom</hi>) but afterwards die in a mere nothing of performance.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude this Point, I muſt needs tell you that I look upon all thoſe no better than ungrateful Blaſphemers and Liers, that ſay God hath required us to perform thoſe things which he hath not given us abilitys whereby we may cooperate with him in doing thoſe things which he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned us to do, and in avoiding thoſe things he hath forbidden, and yet it ſhall be our Condemnation. <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, that Man's refuſing God's Grace, evidently preſuppoſes there is in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man a real power to imbrace it.</p>

                  <p>Common Grace is the ſingle Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of Reaſon and Underſtanding, with the good things of this Life which all Men injoy; and thoſe that live under or within the ſound of the Goſpel call, are under the external Offers of Grace (we are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law but under Grace, that is, the Goſpel) yea and may from thence receive common Grace, <hi>viz.</hi> Illumination, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, legal Humiliation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

This is not like the Righteouſneſs and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of God's Proceedings with wicked
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:35591:152"/> and ungodly Men, to bring the Vengeance of Eternal Fire upon the Heads of thoſe who did not do that which was impoſſible for them to do: ſurely we ſhall be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Lord for no more than what we receive from him, according to that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Equity atteſted by our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 48. for <hi>unto whom much is given, of him much ſhall be required;</hi> and then by the rule of contraries, unto whom but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is given, but little ſhall be required.

                  <speaker>Philet.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not queſtion but I was beloved of God, and choſen in Chriſt,

                  <p>I ſuppoſe that you muſt needs have a high Opinion of your ſelf, that you are one of the Darlings of Heaven, one beyond all poſſibility of miſcarrying, one that ſhall never behold the angry Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Almighty; otherwiſe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you would be glad to hear the joyful Tidings of Peace and Reconciliation with God through Jeſus Chriſt: for tho you repreſent God at ſo dreadful a rate towards others, yet you would not have him appear in ſuch Wrath and Fury to your ſelf; nay, your Doctrine would not be ſo readily imbraced by ſo many, if they thought they themſelves were of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that God had by an abſolute Decree of Reprobation ſhut under Wrath, from all poſſibility of obtaining Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And ſhould the Lord awaken your Conſcience under a ſenſe of the dread and horror of your being abſolutely rejected from Grace and Glory, from having any ſaving benefit by the Death of Chriſt, this might ſo amaze you, that all Means and Arguments uſed to comfort you, might be of no value; your Opinion walks Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to all words of comfort.</p>
                  <p>What would it avail you then at ſuch a time to tell you of God's great Love to his Elect, and that he had ſuch a Love for ſome few of the degenerate Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:35591:156"/> rather than they ſhould periſh, he would give his Son a Ranſom for them, and with him give them Faith and Repentance, and by a ſtrong hand of irreſiſtible Grace carry them through this World to Glory; but that far the greater number are left of the Lord to die and periſh, for the manifeſtation of his Juſtice and Diſpleaſure againſt Sin? Would this faſten any comfort upon you, when you behold the Lord's angry Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, only ſpeaking Blood and Ruin to you? Come, <hi>Philetus,</hi> this hath been ſo dreadful to many, that they have run ſome to the Sword, and others to the Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Now ſeeing that you make the number of the Elect ſo ſmall, as not one in a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, or one in a thouſand; how can you have any comfortable aſſurance that you are one of thoſe that Chriſt died for, unleſs you prove it by his dying for all, and ſo conſequently for you, including a part in the whole.</p>

                  <p>What rotten ſtuff have we here, at what a pitiful rate do you talk! would you have me believe Chriſt died for me, becauſe he died for the whole World? if I had no other aſſurance and hopes for Heaven than this, I ſhould be in a miſerable ſtate; I injoy ſaving Grace, there is an inward Work of God upon my Heart, and I am really brought over to Chriſt; this is a better proof that I am not one of thoſe that
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:35591:156"/> are left in the Fall to periſh, but one of thoſe Chriſt died for.</p>

                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>I own that there are Marks and Signs which may be ſufficient proof of a Perſon's Regeneration, and may be a good Mark of Election, and a ſound Evidence for Heaven, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. <hi>the Spirit witneſſing with our Spirits.</hi> But now in this weighty concern of our Souls and Salvation, nothing ought to be believed by any, but what they have grounds to believe from the Word of God, and from that inward Witneſs, which if true, never contradicts, but is always ſutable and agreeable to the Word. Now ſince by your Doctrine the Death of Chriſt did not extend to one of a thouſand, how is it poſſible for you to know that Chriſt died for you, unleſs it be revealed in the Word of God, ſince he that Chriſt did or did not die for, muſt be built upon the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Lord? therefore, I ſay, ſhew me (if you can) a proof from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that Chriſt died for you; or if you cannot do that, ſhew me that Man now living in the World for whom Chriſt did not die.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philet.</speaker>
                  <p>I cannot ſhew you my Name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Scriptures, nor no place that ſaith that he died for <hi>I. S.</hi> but if I can prove my ſelf a Believer, I can prove that I am no Reprobate, but an Elect Perſon, and conſequently one that Chriſt died for,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:35591:157"/> for believing is an infallible Fruit of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>But what if you miſtake, and think you have true Faith when you have not; there is a Faith which is only ſancy, nay mere preſumption, a Faith beſides the Word of God: 'tis eaſy for Men to deceive themſelves and others with falſe Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and deceivable Marks in this caſe, ſince all ſaving Graces in the Saints have their Counterfeits in Hypocrites, yea oftner furniſhed and ſet forth with more gaudy paint in Hypocrites than real Chriſtians; the Devil can ſhew himſelf to be an Angel of Light. But come to your Marks of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, Are you the Child of believing Parents? this is not ſufficient to prove you in the Love and Favour of God; for ſo was <hi>Cain, Iſhmael,</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> yet you ſay they were reprobated. Have you been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and ſo initiated into the viſible Church of Chriſt? ſo have many thouſands, who by their Converſation ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be of the Synagogue of Satan.</p>
                  <p>Have you done Miracles? ſo did <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> yet they were Cheats.</p>
                  <p>Do you outwardly partake of the Lord's Table? ſo do many that have no part in him, as <hi>Judas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Do you preach the Word to others, propheſy in Chriſt's Name? ſo may many to whom Chriſt will ſay, <hi>Depart you curſed,</hi>
                     <pb n="293" facs="tcp:35591:157"/> and while they preach Salvation to others, miſs it themſelves.</p>

                  <p>Theſe are outward Marks which may very well ſtand with Hypocriſy; mine is a ſupernatural, ſpiritual, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Work, the ſaving Effect of the ſanctifying Spirit of God. What ſay you to Faith, is not that a Fruit of the Spirit?</p>

                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>Yea, true juſtifying Faith is; but what would you prove that Chriſt died for you, becauſe you are a Believer?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philet.</speaker>
                  <p>No, Chriſt did not die for me, and elect me, becauſe I believe; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God elected me, and gave his Son to die for me, therefore I believe; I being to prove that God loved me, and gave his Son to die for me, and that Faith is a Fruit of God's electing Love.</p>

                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>But what if your Faith be the Faith of the Hypocrite, which will periſh? <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Acts 8. 13. believed the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine preached by <hi>Philip,</hi> and profeſſed his Faith publickly, by being baptized in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter according to our Lord's Command, and yet in the gall of bitterneſs, and bond of iniquity; for his heart was not right in the ſight of God. And ſaith <hi>Duveil</hi> upon this place, <q rend="inline">Many that are not of a right heart in the ſight of God, may oftentimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in the Gift of the Spirit, for neither did the perverſeneſs and Hypocriſy of <hi>Judas</hi> the Traitor hinder him to excel
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:35591:158"/> in the Gifts of the Spirit; neither had the Gifts of the Spirit been ſo corrupted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. if their hearts had been ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 13. <hi>Theſe are they which for a time believe,</hi> and in time of temptation fall a way.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we are fallen into an Age, that the practick part of Chriſtianity is almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd by the ſpeculative part: As if the truth of our Faith did not ſtand with a courſe of holineſs and ſtrict walking with God. And, as Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> ſaith in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the <hi>Life of God in the Soul of Man,</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">That in more antient times thoſe that wrote Apologies for the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did appeal to the Lives of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to prove their Doctrine holy; but alas, when we write Apologies, we muſt appeal from the Life to the Rule and Precepts of Faith, which ought not to be.</q>

                  <p>May not this be found in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6? So tho I do not charge you to be a Hypocrite, to pretend to what you do not injoy, yet this I ſay, ſince every ſaving Grace in the true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath its counterfeit in others, this will not be ſufficient to prove Chriſt died for you, but muſt find better grounds for it than ſuch marks, which are as proper for Hypocrites as true Believers: you may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have an opinion that Chriſt died for you; but where are your grounds, ſeeing the certain knowledg whom Chriſt died for, muſt not be built upon any good which we may ſuppoſe in us, but upon the Word of the Lord: ſo till it be proved, beyond all Objection, that Chriſt died for you, and hath not decreed to leave you in the Fall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all comfortable aſſurance of your Eternal State will be cut off, if ever you ſhould fall under the dread and horror of it; and methinks, could I be got to believe
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:35591:159"/> that Chriſt died but for a few, and no Man could prove Chriſt died for him but by ſuch Marks as you talk of, I am ſo conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the failings and deceitfulneſs of my own heart, that I ſhould deſpair of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: but here's my ſupport, that God would have all Men to be ſaved, hath redeemed all, calleth all to Repentance and believing in him, with gracious promiſes of Life and Salvation; and now ſeeing God loveth all Men, and deſireth their eternal good, therefore mine as well as others, if I by true Faith apply that (through the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Spirit) to my ſelf, which is offered in general to all.</p>
                  <p>And how doth the certain knowledg of this tend to beget honourable thoughts of God, and fill our Hearts with precious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearedneſs to Chriſt? yea, ſoften our Hearts when we ſin againſt ſuch Mercy and Grace, yea, make us look upon him whom we have pierced, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. Yea and if at any time poor Souls come to be bowed down under the weight of Sin, and knows not how to be delivered from their fears and dangers, but are ready with the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 18. to ſit down and ſay, <hi>My hope is periſhed from the Lord:</hi> Now at ſuch a time as this, when the Love of God in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is ſet home upon the Heart, O what work will this make upon ſuch a one! O the dear Love that this begets in a ſincere
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:35591:159"/> Soul for Chriſt! and O, methinks what a comfort is it to Goſpel-Miniſters that in their declarations of the Goſpel they can offer it to all, and labour with Souls to bring them over to the Lord! But how faint and cooly muſt other Miniſters be in tendering of Chriſt to Sinners; or how can your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters tender Chriſt to their hearers, or be earneſt with them to imbrace Chriſt, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, when they do not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt died for one of them?</p>
                  <p>So notwithſtanding all you have ſaid to prove your Title for Heaven, and to be one of thoſe that Chriſt died for, yet ſince you place Salvation upon the abſolute Decree of God, and that Decree is kept ſecret to you, you cannot ſay of your ſelf you are one of thoſe that Chriſt died for, and that you ſhall go to Heaven becauſe you at preſent believe; no more than you can ſay of any wicked Man in the World, that he is one of thoſe that God hath left in the Fall, without a Saviour, ſince he that is now wicked may be called and ſaved; <hi>ſuch were ſome of you,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. and you may make ſhipwrack of Faith and a good Conſcience, fall from your firſt Love, and ſo miſs Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

                  <p>How any one can eſcape the Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet not be a Believer, I know not.</p>

                  <speaker>Philet.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis meant of groſs Pollutions of the World, and ſo a Man may be free from the groſs pollutions of this World in the midſt of inward Impurities and Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; they were free from the groſs acts of Sin, ſo that they did not come into the view of the World.</p>

                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>That is as much as to ſay, their eſcaping was not real, they had but ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly eſcaped the pollutions of the World;
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:35591:160"/> they were at beſt but Hypocrites, how then could the latter end of ſuch be worſe than their beginning? Nay, what if they had put off their guiſe of Religion wherewith they deceive the World, and appeared like themſelves in their ſwiniſh nature, could that make their end worſe than before, ſeeing Hypocrites are like to meet with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt condemnation? <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 51. But how thoſe can be ſaid to be Hypocrites, that have clean eſcaped the Pollution of the World, thro the knowledg of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, I cannot ſee, unleſs Hypocriſy be no Pollution; and if it be, then were they no Hypocrites, or elſe they had not clean eſcaped the pollution of the World, nor from them that live in Error, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. which he affirms. But we muſt haſten to put an end to this days Diſcourſe. Now conſider <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6. where the Author ſpeaks of the impoſſibility of renewing ſome by repentance in caſe they fall away: which plainly ſuppoſeth there is, or may be ſuch a thing incident to Man; and it is very evident from this Scripture, that the Author admoniſheth thoſe whom he judged true and ſound Believers, for he here ſpeaketh not of ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but of ſpecial and excellent Grace; and yet theſe are under a poſſibility of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away for ever: for doth not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor give them to underſtand, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:35591:161"/> they were moſt eminent Saints and Believers; yet through care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs and carnal Security, they might make Shipwrack of their Souls, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philet.</speaker>
                  <p>What, are theſe Characters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to none but true Believers?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>If there be any Perſons under Heaven that may be judged true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, they are ſuch as theſe mentioned; and if you can, ſhew me any that had all theſe Gifts, and yet were deſtitute of true Grace.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philet.</speaker>
                  <p>I cannot give you a particular Inſtance of all theſe meeting together in one Perſon that was not a Believer: But can you prove that theſe Qualifications are applicable to none but true Believers?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>If they be applicable to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, give me an Inſtance where; for I know of none from whence we have cauſe to believe that true Believers may poſſibly apoſtatize ſo far, as to be under an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of being renewed again by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſo periſh. Again, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27. you may ſee that Holy <hi>Paul,</hi> after his Converſion to Chriſt, took great care and pains to beat down his Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was needleſs in him, if he were under no poſſibility of falling.</p>
                  <p>Again, that true Believers are under a poſſibility of falling, appears a truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:35591:161"/> the Lord by his Holy Spirit in his Prophets and Apoſtles doth, by many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, Promiſes, and Threatnings, labour to prevent apoſtatizing in them, and to cauſe them to perſevere.</p>
                  <p>But if your Doctrine be true, that there is an utter impoſſibility of a final falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; what ſavour of Wiſdom or Senſe is there in admoniſhing Perſons againſt that which there is no poſſibility of ever coming to paſs; but that God will by an irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hand of Grace and Power, preſerve them in a ſtate of Grace and Favour, how deſperately careleſs or wicked ſoever they ſhall be? yea, tho they fall into ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand abominable Sins, yet they ſhall be brought to repentance before they die: doth not this make all Exhortations, Threatnings and Promiſes, unneceſſary? For if Men be aſſured they ſhall never pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, pray tell me why they ſhould labour to prevent their periſhing?</p>

                  <speaker>Moderat.</speaker>
                  <p>But you muſt underſtand that the Means and the End are coupled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that God that hath appointed the End, hath appointed the Means to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the End; and God makes uſe of our own Endeavours as the Means to attain Heaven, and prevent our Apoſtacy; as in the caſe of <hi>Noah,</hi> tho he was aſſured, and that from God himſelf, that he ſhould not periſh by the Water, yet he was to make
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:35591:162"/> the Ark: here you ſee that tho he knew God would ſave him, yet he uſed the means, or elſe he knew he ſhould not be ſaved; he did not ſay to himſelf, God hath bound himſelf by Covenant to ſave me; now if I make not the Ark, his Word is his Word, and he will ſtand to it; tho I be falſe, yet he will be true; tho I do not as I ſhould, yet he will do as he hath promiſed, and therefore I'll ſpare my labour: but you ſee <hi>Noah</hi> is of another mind, he will not ſever God's Word from the Means; he judged that if he made not the Ark, he was to look for no deliverance; this was his Divinity. So in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Caſe, tho God had promiſed to add fifteen years to his Life, yet he was to uſe the means God had appointed to ſuſtain Life, as Meat, Drink, Reſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, tho the Lord had abſolutely promiſed that he would add fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years to his Life, yet there was to be a Plaiſter of Figs applied to his Sore in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his recovery. So likewiſe in that of <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 27. 22. compared with 31. tho the Lord had promiſed there ſhould be no loſs of any Man's Life, yet afterwards <hi>Paul ſaid to the Centurion, and the Souldiers, Except theſe</hi> (to wit, the Mariners, by whoſe skill the Ship ſhould be brought nearer to Land for their ſafety) <hi>abide in the Ship, ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſafe.</hi> So tho Chriſt had aſſured his Diſciples that they ſhould never periſh,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:35591:162"/> and none ſhould pluck them out of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Hands; yet he bid them <hi>watch and pray, leſt they fall into temptation.</hi>

                  <p>I perceive you look upon theſe Promiſes, tho abſolutely expreſs'd, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally intended; ſo that none of all theſe ſhould periſh, provided they ſhould obey wholeſom Advice, and uſe all Means that in them lay for their preſervation; now do you believe this is true in Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als?</p>

                  <p>I ſay ſo too; and dare be bold to aſſure, from the Word and Promiſe of that God that cannot lie, that not one true Believer ſhall ever periſh who faithfully uſes the means God hath preſcribed, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his ſtanding. And if <hi>Philetus</hi> be of this mind, we ſhall ſoon agree: What ſay you <hi>Philetus?</hi>

                  <p>I believe, as God hath required his Children to uſe the means of Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſo he hath decreed they ſhall all of them uſe it accordingly; and that he will ſo overpower them by his Spirit, that it ſhall be beyond all poſſibility of miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying.</p>

                  <p>In <hi>Jer</hi> 31. 33 to 37. you have an abſolute Promiſe of Perſeverance made by the Lord to the Church of God.</p>

                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>You cannot prove by this Text, that none can fall away: this Promiſe was made to the diſperſed Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom the Lord in his anger had driven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Countrys, and therefore had a reſpect as well to the Unbelievers as true Believers amongſt them: Compare <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 17, 18. where is a Promiſe of the ſame import; yet in <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. thoſe that walk after their deteſtable things, may bring ruin upon themſelves.</p>

                     <hi>John</hi> 10. 27, 28. <hi>My Sheep hear my Voice, and I know them, and they follow me; and I give unto them Eternal Life, and they ſhall never periſh,</hi> &amp;c. Now I believe that thoſe that are the Sheep of Chriſt, which hearing his Voice, follow him perſevering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the end, he will give unto them Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life; there's no danger of periſhing ſo long as they remain the Sheep of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>This cavil is cut off in the next Words; <hi>neither ſhall any pluck them out of my hands:</hi> therefore neither Sin, the Devil, the World, nor Fleſh, can by any Temptation draw the Sheep of Chriſt from their Faith.</p>

                  <p>How, who told you ſo? <hi>I give them Eterual Life;</hi> neither ſhall may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:35591:163"/> to pluck them out of Chriſt's hands, when once they are landed upon the Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Canaan;</hi> they may then ſay, Now Sin, Satan, and wicked World, do your worſt. But if you would have it reſpect the Saints as to this Life, yet here is not the leaſt ſhew of the great power of God ingaged for the compelling or neceſſitating of them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſuch to the end of their days, and that they cannot ceaſe from following him; or any promiſe made to thoſe that for the preſent hear his Voice and follow him: yet if they ſhall quit the Faith, and draw back from him, they ſhall never periſh, how ſinful and wicked ſoever they be. Neither is it to be conceived, as if Sin, Wickedneſs, Looſeneſs, and Profaneneſs, could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaint Perſons, or pluck them from under the Lord's protection, or ſeparate them from the Love of God; but that Sin will ſeparate between Men and their God, is evident from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 2. But this rather ſhews, That thoſe that continue following of Chriſt, ſhall be ſafe under the protection and ſafeguard of the Lord, ſo as no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whatſoever ſhall be able to ſeparate them from God.</p>

                  <p>As God the Father looks for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from Man to partake of Chriſt; ſo it is not Sin nor Evil that can debar any true Believer from a part in Chriſt. It is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate thing in any ſo much as to
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:35591:164"/> ſerve a Writ of Damnation upon a Believer, for in doing ſo they injure the Lord Jeſus, overthrowing the fulneſs of his Grace.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>That God hath made an aſſurance to any of injoying his Love and Favour, but upon condition of their Love and Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to him, I ſuppoſe the Scripture is wholly ſilent; nay ſuch aſſurance is not honourable for God to make, nor meet for a Creature to expect or deſire: for who can imagine that an infinitely wiſe, and righteous God, ſhould ever ingage himſelf to any People, to be their God, unleſs they be alſo willing to be his People, to love and live to him? or what ingenuous Soul, that truly loves God, doth deſire to be pardoned, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, and delivered from eternal Miſery, and injoy all the Bleſſings of his Child, and yet pay nothing of that love and reverence that is due to him for ſuch Mercys?</p>
                  <p>And whereas you ſpeak as if it were not Sin and Evil that can make him that was once a Believer leſs beloved of God, the Lord having once loved him, he cannot ceaſe to love him; this I have anſwered before. But ſuch Expreſſions as theſe cannot be ſhort of Blaſphemy, to put ſuch a Saying as this in the Mouth of the Lord: Tho thou addeſt Drunkenneſs to Thirſt; tho thou committeſt Whoredom, Adultery, Inceſt, Murder, and every ways caſt my
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:35591:164"/> Commandments behind thy back, yet ſhalt thou be precious in my Eyes, and my heart ſhall be towards thee in the greateſt Love and deareſt Affection for ever. And tho this may ſeem harſh, yet your opinion leads directly to ſuch horrid conceits of God.</p>
                  <p>For if Chriſt be not given Covenant-wiſe, but the Promiſe of Life is made ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, without any condition, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo at all of Perſons Love and Loyalty to him, then it follows, that the obſtinate and reſolved Sinners, the looſeſt and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched Perſons may as well lay claim to the Promiſe of Eternal Life, as the moſt faithful and virtuous in the World: and if you ſay 'tis not Abſolute, it follows that it is Conditional, for the wit of Man cannot ſhew a Medium between theſe two.</p>

                  <p>Who ever ſaid that the Elect, ſuch that believe and perſevere to the end, ever fell away finally?

I would know why our Saviour hath told us, that <hi>from him
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:35591:165"/> that hath not, ſhall be taken away even that which he ſeemeth to have,</hi> if it be not for this reaſon, becauſe he hath laviſhed out his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and hath rejected the Power of doing well which was offered him: ſurely there is no better arguing than that Man can reſiſt the Grace of God, becauſe he doth; and 'tis a wonder that ſuch as you are, are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by your own experience that Grace is reſiſtible, unleſs you will deny your ſelf to be of the number of the Elect.</p>
                  <p>Surely <hi>David</hi> had Grace to have done better than he did in the matter of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi> but he reſiſted it, and lay in his Sin a long time; which ſhews that the precious Veſſels of Election may fall away from Grace (whether we take it for a gracious Life, or for the Love and Favour of God) for had he been taken away in his Sin without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, he might have periſhed,</p>

                  <p>The Seed is Grace by your own grant, and it is for the ſubſtance of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, unperiſhable, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>John</hi> 3. 9. &amp; 17. 3. &amp; 10. 28, 29. &amp; 6. 54. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 13. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith failed ſadly as to the act, but the Seed remained, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he was kept by the Power of God that he did not finally fall away.</p>

                  <p>'Tis true, the Seed, or the Word of God, is in its own nature incorruptible, tho all the Men in the whole World ſhould reject it: 'tis not called <hi>incorruptible</hi> becauſe it cannot be forſaken, or taken from thoſe in whom it hath a reſidence for the preſent; but becauſe whether it be taken away or forſaken by them or not, whether it be received or rejected, yet ſtill it remains in it ſelf incorruptible and unperiſhable. But you ſeem to lay the ſtreſs upon the word <hi>remain,</hi> to ſhew that true Believers cannot
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:35591:166"/> fall away; now the ſame Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſuppoſeth that the ſame Seed or Word might not remain, by the word <hi>if,</hi> Chap. 2. 24. <hi>If that which you have heard from the beginning, ſhall remain in you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>you alſo ſhall continue in the Son, and in the Father,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>I have written to you young Men, becauſe you are ſtrong, and the Word of God abides in you;</hi> yet that this was ſubject to be loſt, appears by <hi>ver.</hi> 28. where he exhorts the ſame little Children <hi>to abide in him, that they might not be aſhamed at his coming:</hi> ſurely the Apoſtle would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh to that which it was impoſſible ſhould fall out otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>So Chriſt promiſeth that the Comforter ſhould abide with his Diſciples for ever, <hi>John</hi> 14. 6. Yet that doth not ſuppoſe that it was impoſſible for them to fall, for he tells them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 2. That <hi>every Branch in me</hi> (mind, <hi>in me) that hears not Fruit, he taketh away:</hi> And, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>If ye keep my Commandments, ye ſhall abide in my Love.</hi> Chriſt never ſaid to any of his Diſciples, That the moſt abominable Practices you can commit, ſhall never leſſen my Love to you; nor is it poſſible you ſhould die in your Sins, in the midſt of your Impieties; there is a Seed of Grace in you that ſhall keep you from final falling away.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, ſo long as a Man is a true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, the Seed remains; but when once a
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:35591:167"/> Man departs from that ſtate, then the Seed doth not abide in him; ſo that the word <hi>remain,</hi> or <hi>abide,</hi> doth not imply that it ſhall never depart: the Scripture tells us, <hi>John</hi> 3. 36. That <hi>he that believes not, the Wrath of God abides upon him;</hi> doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from hence, that it is impoſſible for him that is an Unbeliever, and as ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the abiding Wrath of God, to be a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever?</p>
                  <p>So Whoremongers, Adulterers, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 4. are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the loſs of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, without any mention made, that if they repent afterwards, the Puniſhment ſhall be reverſed; yet would it not be ſtrange Divinity to affirm, That no ſuch kind of Sinners ſhall enjoy Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon their Repentance. So God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth Life and Salvation to juſt and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Men, without mentioning the loſs of Life and Salvation they are like to ſuſtain in caſe they turn aſide; yet manifeſt it is in Scripture, ſuch are threatned with <hi>death and deſtruction,</hi> as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 24, 25. &amp; 33. 12, 13. it being ordinary in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to predict unto Men, both Future Puniſhment and Reward, according to their preſent Ways, whether Good or Evil.</p>

                  <p>I believe many Believers fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; but by their falling away they plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>The Apoſtle ſpeaks <hi>of ſome in his days that made Shipwrack of Faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <speaker>Philet.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, what Faith was it? It was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a temporary Faith, or a light believing the Goſpel, ſuch as believe for a ſeaſon, and then fall away, like the ſtony ground; but this differs much from true Juſtifying Faith.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>He that received the Seed in ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ground, might be a true Believer as well as the other; for that Faith which ſprings from the ſame Seed of the Goſpel, muſt needs be of one and the ſame nature and kind; neither doth the withering of a man's Faith in time of Temptation, prove he never had true Faith, or that it differs in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from that which is real and endures to the end: the Scripture owns no ſuch diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that I know of; neither do I ſee but that that Faith which indureth but a ſhort time, may be as real and true in Nature, as that which abides all a Man's days.</p>
                  <p>But if a temporary Faith, a Faith that is not accompanied with Juſtification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, be the Faith that theſe are ſaid to fall from; then is it ſuch a Faith that they are exhorted to perſevere in: and ſurely he would not exhort them to keep ſuch a Faith with which they might periſh, and which would certainly fail them; neither can you
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:35591:168"/> poſſibly prove that <hi>thoſe that made Shipwrack of Faith and a good Conſcience,</hi> never were true Believers.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if to fall from a falſe hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal dead Faith, be the Apoſtacy that the Scripture ſpeaks of; ſurely it would not be a Sin of ſo high a provocation to God (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi>) as the Scriptures declare it to be, and which you in your preaching and printing declare it to be. But I muſt away, I ſhall be thought long.</p>

                  <p>One word more, What ſay you to <hi>John</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Having loved his own which were in the World, he loved them to the end?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>Who queſtions the continuance of God's or Chriſt's Love to thoſe that continue in love, and faithful to him? The queſtion is of the continuance of our Love to him, <hi>John</hi> 8. 31. <hi>If ye continue in my Word,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 15. 9, 10. <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you; continue ye in my Love: And if ye keep my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ye ſhall abide in my Love.</hi> Now if there were no danger of loſing their Love to Chriſt, there were no need for Chriſt to exhort them to keep his Commands, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their abiding in his Love. But this place ſhews that Chriſt having loved his own, he loved them to the end of his days; 'tis not ſaid of their days, but all the time of his abode in the World: here's nothing of the final perſeverance of the Saints, how
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:35591:168"/> deſperately wicked ſoever they be: but what if the Lord ſhould ſo ſet his Love up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe his beloved Diſciples that were given him out of the World by his Father, that maugre all the Frailties of the Fleſh, and the Temptations of the World, and the Devil, yet none of them ſhould be loſt, but that they ſhould be carried on through all Difficulties to the fruition of Eternal Glory? Doth it prove, that becauſe ſome ſhall never fall, that therefore no true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever can fall away? Pray conſider the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Prodigal Son, the loſt Groat, the loſt Sheep; doth it not ſhew that a true Believer may be loſt, and being loſt may be found?</p>

                  <speaker>Moderat.</speaker>
                  <p>I believe God hath elected a certain number to Salvation; and thoſe that are given out of the World to Chriſt, he will not fail to keep them to himſelf, but will, by interpoſing Grace, ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, that they ſhall never periſh: But the others that Chriſt died for, upon condition of their repentance, believing and perſevering therein to the end, I dare not ſay but ſome of theſe may believe for a time (and that with a true Faith) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and yet fall away ſo as to periſh: theſe times have afforded many ſad and ſhaking Examples of this kind, and I am not ſtrictly certain of my perſeverance, and ſo not fully or ſtrictly certain of my own Salvation.</p>

                  <p>O what an uncomfortable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is this of falling from Grace?</p>

                  <speaker>Philad.</speaker>
                  <p>This Doctrine doth not deſtroy all Chriſtian Comfort, but a Life of much Chriſtian Comfort may be had out of it, ſeeing it is the unchangeable Purpoſe of God to give Life and Salvation to all thoſe that ſhall perſevere in Faith and Holineſs to the end; and that if they will but quit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like Men, abſtain from all fooliſh and hurtful Luſts, and not wilfully ſtab their own Souls, nor pull Miſery upon their own Heads, they ſhall be happy.</p>
                  <p>And what tho true Believers may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a poſſibility of periſhing, yet ſeeing God hath through his bounty vouchſafed unto them ſo rich, and ſuch full proportion of Means, thereby to prevent their periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to preſerve them from Apoſtacy, ſo that they need not apoſtatize or periſh except they themſelves pleaſe; why ſhould it abate any of their Comforts or Hopes of Salvation, becauſe under a poſſibility of periſhing?</p>
                  <p>Men may poſſibly fall into the Fire and be burnt, or into the Water and be drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from the top of Houſes and be daſhed in pieces; yet no Man lives ever a whit the more uncomfortable, becauſe under a poſſibility of ſuffering theſe Evils, becauſe they know God hath given them Reaſon and Underſtanding to preſerve them from
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:35591:169"/> theſe things. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> knew that he was under a poſſibility of being a Caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27. yet how chearfully, and at what an excellent rate of comfort did he live; <hi>I am perſwaded,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 38, 39. <hi>that neither death, nor life, nor things preſent, nor things to come,</hi> &amp;c. The aſſurance he had, that upon a diligent uſe of the means which God of his Grace had vouchſafed to him, he ſhould prevent his being a Caſtaway, made him live at that height of confidence and courage which he did.</p>
                  <p>What can no one injoy comfortable hopes of Heaven, unleſs they have a full and perfect aſſurance of the continuance of the Love of God to them, how looſely and profanely ſoever they live; and that if they commit all manner of Sin and Wickedneſs, affront Heaven, defy the Almighty, laugh Jeſus and his Goſpel to ſcorn, yet they run no hazard of loſing their Souls? Indeed ſuch a Doctrine as this (and ſuch is the Doctrine of Abſolute and Unconditional Perſeverance) contributes to the peace and comfort of the carnal part in Men, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgeth to them a liberty of Sin; but no Child of God that hath received of that Spirit whereby it can cry, <hi>Abba Father,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſheth or deſires Heaven or Salvation but in the way of holineſs, and upon that condition which the Lord Chriſt injoyned
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:35591:170"/> it, <hi>John</hi> 15. 10. Nor is it poſſible that any Man ſhould have comfortable hopes of Heaven, or any aſſurance of being ſaved, unleſs he hath, through Grace, diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thoſe Duties to which the Bleſſing and Privileges are therein promiſed: This is the Foundation whereupon, through Chriſt, to build our Hopes and Comforts, and not that God loves us for we know not what reaſon, and that we cannot poſſibly ſin our ſelves out of his Love, but he will infallibly bring us to Heaven; no, but ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 3, 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 18, 19, 20, 24. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>hereby we know</hi> and are aſſured <hi>that we are in God, and that he loves us.</hi> But how comes Perſons to this? why, <hi>if we love him, and keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> which if we do, we ſhall never fall, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt beg your excuſe at this time, I cannot ſtay; only I deſire you to conſider this one thing concerning falling from true Grace.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider Faith and Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in themſelves, they may be loſt, becauſe nothing in it ſelf is unchangeable but God; it cannot be ſaid of any but God, that <hi>he cannot lie:</hi> and if ſo, then all Men may lie, and that Lie may be our ruin for ought we know, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. And tho I do not doubt but that there is a State of Grace attainable in this Life, from which
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:35591:170"/> Perſons by the Grace of God ſhall never fall, yet I would not have you affirm of your ſelves, or any others, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall, how wicked ſoever you live; but rather remember we all ſtand but by Faith, and therefore ought not to be high-minded, but fear, working out our Salvation with fear and trembling, not leſt God ſhould forſake us, but leſt we ſhould forſake God.</p>
